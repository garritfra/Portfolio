{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-11-30-why-you-can't-divide-by-zero","markdownBody":"\r\nI've always been wondering why dividing by zero is considered undefined. My intuitive answer would have always been \"infinity\" or \"zero\". I just had a discussion about this with a collegue who happens to have a degree in mathematics, and the way they explained it made it absolutely clear why it doesn't make sense to divide by zero.\r\n\r\n## Inverse Operations\r\n\r\nBefore understanding why dividing by zero is undefined, you first need to know about inverse operations. It's quite simple!\r\n\r\nAn example: `3 + 2 = 5`. The inverse of addition is *subtraction*, so the inverse of this equation is `5 - 2 = 3` or `5 - 3 = 2`.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to multiplication. The inverse of multiplation is *division*. So the inverse of `6 * 2 = 12` is `12 / 2 = 6` or `12 / 6 = 2`.\r\n\r\n## Dividing by zero\r\n\r\nLet's try to apply the inverse rule to the number zero, starting with addition. If `2 + 0 = 2`, then `2 - 0 = 2`.\r\n\r\nBut if we have `2 * 0 = 0`, the inverse of that would be `0 / 0 = 2`, which is just not true.\r\n\r\nDividing by zero breaks some fundamental laws of mathematics, which is why there's a general consensus that any equasion dividing by zero has no valid answer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 090 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Why you can't divide by zero","date":"2023-11-30","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, til, math"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","til","math"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-01-30-to-proof-something-is-true-try-disproofing-it-first","frontmatter":{"title":"To proof something is true, try disproofing it first","date":"2024-01-30","tags":"note, quote, practices, til, science"},"tags":["note","quote","practices","til","science"]},{"slug":"2023-12-19-another-reason-you-can-t-divide-by-zero","frontmatter":{"title":"Another reason why you can't divide by zero","date":"2023-12-19","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, til, math"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","til","math"]},{"slug":"2023-12-18-overcoming-air-hunger","frontmatter":{"title":"Overcoming \"air hunger\"","date":"2023-12-18","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, life, til"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","life","til"]},{"slug":"2023-12-11-formula-e-is-essentially-mario-kart","frontmatter":{"title":"Formula E is essentially Mario Kart","date":"2023-12-11","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, til, random"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","til","random"]},{"slug":"2023-11-01-tracking-sqlite-database-changes-in-git","frontmatter":{"title":"Tracking SQLite Database Changes in Git","date":"2023-11-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech, sqlite"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech","sqlite"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
