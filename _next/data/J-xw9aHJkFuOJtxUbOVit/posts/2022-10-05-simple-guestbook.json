{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-10-05-simple-guestbook","markdownBody":"\n> **TL;DR**: Click [here](/guestbook) to view the guestbook.\n\nFor a while now, I wanted to have a quick way to update the pages on my website.\n\nGitHub has the\n[\".\"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts#source-code-editing)\nhotkey, which opens a web based editor for the file you're currently viewing.\nThis site now has this feature as well! To try it out, just hit `.`, and you'll\nbe redirected to the file editor for this page.\n\nTo see how I implemented this feature, you take a look at\n[this](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/commit/658efa3a3ebfebebbf74d0eb6aae6c1cc9566516)\ncommit. It boils down to this snippet of code:\n\n```js\nwindow.addEventListener(\"keypress\", (e) => {\n\tif (e.key === \".\") {\n\t\tconst baseUrl = \"https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/edit/main/content\";\n\t\tconst filePath = window.location.pathname;\n\t\tconst url = `${baseUrl}${filePath}.md`;\n\n\t\twindow.location.href = url;\n\t}\n});\n```\n\nPretty simple, huh?\n\nSince this doesn't work on mobile devices, I also added [a custom 404\npage](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/commit/8c374a8bc0b66192c454300489fee52e7299c9dd#diff-2cbafea0c9dff483ebab9ad670b1cdb3eb7aac552f9c161e42fee84c2efe3a69)\nwhich also redirects to the editor, if the filepath ends with in `/edit`.\n\nLet's have some fun and put this feature to use. I added a simple\n[guestbook](/guestbook) to this site, which is open to receive pull requests.\nI'd love to hear from you!\n\nThis is post 040 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"A simple guestbook","date":"2022-10-05","tags":"note, meta, 100DaysToOffload, guide"},"tags":["note","meta","100DaysToOffload","guide"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-12-12-roast-my-site","frontmatter":{"title":"Roast my Site!","date":"2023-12-12","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, meta, writing, web, random"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","meta","writing","web","random"]},{"slug":"2023-11-01-tracking-sqlite-database-changes-in-git","frontmatter":{"title":"Tracking SQLite Database Changes in Git","date":"2023-11-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech, sqlite"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech","sqlite"]},{"slug":"2023-10-13-organizing-multiple-git-identities","frontmatter":{"title":"Organizing multiple Git identities","date":"2023-10-13","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech"]},{"slug":"2023-07-06-rss-changes","frontmatter":{"title":"PSA: RSS feed changes","date":"2023-07-06","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, meta, rss"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","meta","rss"]},{"slug":"2023-06-01-single-page-applications-on-github-pages","frontmatter":{"title":"Single Page Applications on GitHub Pages","date":"2023-06-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, web, javascript, github"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","web","javascript","github"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
