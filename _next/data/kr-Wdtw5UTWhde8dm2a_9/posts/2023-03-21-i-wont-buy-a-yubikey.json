{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-03-21-i-wont-buy-a-yubikey","markdownBody":"\nI have a YubiKey that I use for work, and I love using it. But I won't get one for my personal life.\n\nI've been thinking about this for some time now, but I ultimately don't think the benefits outweigh the hassle of always carrying around another device that I risk losing or breaking.\n\nA Yubikey provides a very good second factor, but so does my phone. My phone, just like a Yubikey, is locked behind a third factor (a pin or biometric sensor), so my phone essentially *is* a Yubikey. You can argue that the authenticator app on my phone (bitwarden) can be hacked, but I'm willing to take that risk if it means I have to reset all security measures on all accounts if I lose the key.\n\nSo, I'm not getting a Yubikey.\n\n### Replies & Mentions\n\n- [Kev Quirk: re: I won't buy a YubiKey](https://kevquirk.com/i-wont-by-a-yubikey/)\n- [Alson Kaw: Why I won't use a YubiKey](https://alsonkaw.com/muses/why-i-wont-use-a-yubikey/)\n\n---\n\nThis is post 058 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"I won't buy a YubiKey","date":"2023-03-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, privacy, security"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","privacy","security"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-10-10-did-you-try-turning-it-off","frontmatter":{"title":"Did you try turning it off?","date":"2023-10-10","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","life"]},{"slug":"2023-09-29-undo-on-mobile-phones","frontmatter":{"title":"Undo on mobile phones","date":"2023-09-29","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion"]},{"slug":"2023-04-07-older-is-often-better","frontmatter":{"title":"Older is often better","date":"2023-04-07","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","life"]},{"slug":"2023-04-01-quality-vs.-quantity","frontmatter":{"title":"Quality vs. Quantity","date":"2023-04-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, meta, writing, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","meta","writing","life"]},{"slug":"2023-03-26-software-is-not-defined-by-the-language-it's-written-in","frontmatter":{"title":"Software is not defined by the language it's written in","date":"2023-03-26","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, opinion"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","opinion"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
