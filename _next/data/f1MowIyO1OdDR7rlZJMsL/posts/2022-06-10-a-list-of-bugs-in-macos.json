However, it\nhas some really annoying problems that don't seem to get attention by Apple.\nThis is a list of things that personally bother me. I will try to update it\nwhenever I encounter new issues.\n\n- When plugging in a external monitor, some native Windows can't be used with a\n  mouse anymore. Restart required to fix.\n- Dash-to-dock sometimes doesn't work for fullscreen-applications.\n- When opening a fullscreen window from the workspace-overview, the dock\n  sometimes stays visible. Has to be manually hovered to hide.\n- When using a chromium-based browser on an external monitor in\n  fullscreen-mode, the menu-bar sometimes doesn't appear when hovered.\n- When switching from the internal to an external monitor, the workspace\n  alignment is not how I left it.\n\nThis is post 034 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
