{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2024-01-18-cost-per-request","markdownBody":"\nWhen monitoring infrastructure, we often use metrics like \"Requests per second\" or \"Time per request\".\r\n\r\nContrary to that, when monitoring the cost of our infrastructure, we often only review the cloud bill at the end of the month and tell ourselves that those costs are justified for our product.\r\n\r\nWhat if we made \"Cost per request\" a key metric in our observability strategy, alongside \"Requests per second\"?\r\n\r\nIf we follow that path even further, we could derive a standard for how much a request should cost for x% of uptime, across the entire industry. This way, we should be able to identify how much we're overspending for our infrastructure compared to other companies or products.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Cost per Request","date":"2024-01-18","tags":"infrastructure, aws, note, opinion, devops, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","aws","note","opinion","devops","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-06-17-host-your-own-llm","frontmatter":{"title":"Host your own LLM","date":"2024-06-17","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, homelab, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","homelab","tech","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-06-03-i-just-cleaned-up-40-gb-of-brew-caches","frontmatter":{"title":"I just cleaned up 40 GB of Brew caches","date":"2024-06-03","tags":"guide, note, tech"},"tags":["guide","note","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-05-24-going-from-self-hosted-to-managed-software","frontmatter":{"title":"Going from self hosted to managed software","date":"2024-05-24","tags":"infrastructure, note, learnings, opinion, homelab, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","note","learnings","opinion","homelab","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-04-15-beware-of-base64-encoded-strings","frontmatter":{"title":"Beware of base64 encoded strings","date":"2024-04-15","tags":"guide, note, learnings, web, til, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","learnings","web","til","tech","programming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
