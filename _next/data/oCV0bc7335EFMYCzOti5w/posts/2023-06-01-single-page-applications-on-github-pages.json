{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-06-01-single-page-applications-on-github-pages","markdownBody":"\nMy latest project, [sendpasswords.net](https://sendpasswords.net/) is a [Single Page Application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) deployed on GitHub Pages.\n\nGitHub Pages is configured in a way to host static HTML files without any bells and whistles. This means that if you try to fetch a document that's *not* the index, for example `/foo`, the server will try to load the file with that name. \n\nBy nature, SPAs only consist of a single HTML entry point (`index.html` in most cases). It's responsible for routing the user to the correct page if there are multiple paths. And here's the crux: if the user tries to load `/foo`, he will not land at the SPA entry point. Instead, he will see a `404` error.\n\n## The solution\n\nA `404` response will automatically return a file called `404.html`, which we can use to our advantage. After building the application, simply copy the `index.html` to `404.html`, as demonstrated by [this commit](https://github.com/garritfra/sendpasswords.net/commit/66bdb68c229a3ac3386f7816a746155e658eb586). This will use `index.html` to serve the application on the root level, and `404.html` to load *the same app* if the page doesn't exist as a file. Whether the `index.html` is needed if there's already a `404.html` is up to you. I left it in to make clear that this is just a workaround.\n\nThis is a [well known](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69308662/9046809) workaround, but I wanted to bring some extra awareness to it, since it's a problem I ran into a couple of times so far. Happy SPAing!\n\n---\n\nThis is post 069 (nice) of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Single Page Applications on GitHub Pages","date":"2023-06-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, web, javascript, github, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","web","javascript","github","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-01-05-greg-the-developer","frontmatter":{"title":"Greg The Developer","date":"2024-01-05","tags":"note, tech, fun, shortstory, writing, programming, practices"},"tags":["note","tech","fun","shortstory","writing","programming","practices"]},{"slug":"2023-12-28-linkdump-2","frontmatter":{"title":"Linkdump #2","date":"2023-12-28","tags":"note, tech, programming, linkdump"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","linkdump"]},{"slug":"2023-12-22-10-000-hours","frontmatter":{"title":"10.000 Hours","date":"2023-12-22","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, learnings, books, tech, programming"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","learnings","books","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2023-12-21-notes-on-immutability","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on \"Immutability Changes Everything\"","date":"2023-12-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, note, learnings, review, tech, papers"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","note","learnings","review","tech","papers"]},{"slug":"2023-12-20-giving-my-blogroll-more-context","frontmatter":{"title":"re: Giving context to a blogroll","date":"2023-12-20","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, web, meta, reply"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","web","meta","reply"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
