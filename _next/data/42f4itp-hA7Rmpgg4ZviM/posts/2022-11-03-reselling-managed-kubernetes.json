{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-11-03-reselling-managed-kubernetes","markdownBody":"\nI'm currently working on a side project involving reselling Kubernetes clusters.\nWhat I discovered is that it's impossible to resell *managed* Kubernetes, as in\n[EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/de/eks/) and\n[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).\n\nThe only possible scenario where reselling Kubernetes to your and the\nend-customers advantage is to manage the nodes yourself. The reason is the\nscaling of cost per CPU.\n\nWhen renting VMs, the price per CPU often varies for the size of the machine. \nThis leaves the reseller flexibility in the choice of resources. To give you an\nexample, here is the pricing for virtual machines at\n[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/), and the price per CPU:\n\n| Product         | Number of vCPUs    | Price (in €/month) | Price per vCPU (in €/month) |\n|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|\n| CX11            | 1                  | 4.51               | 4.51                        |\n| CPX11           | 2                  | 5.18               | 2.59                        |\n| CPX21           | 3                  | 8.98               | 2.99                        |\n| CPX31           | 4                  | 16.18              | 4.05                        |\n| CPX41           | 8                  | 29.99              | 3.75                        |\n| CPX51           | 16                 | 65.33              | 4.08                        |\n\nWhen comparing this to a managed Kubernetes product like\n[CIVO](https://www.civo.com), we see that the price per CPU stays constant:\n\n| Product         | Number of vCPUs    | Price (in €/month) | Price per vCPU (in €/month) |\n|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Extra Small     | 1                  | 5                  | 5                           |\n| Small           | 2                  | 10                 | 5                           |\n| Medium          | 4                  | 20                 | 5                           |\n| Large           | 8                  | 40                 | 5                           |\n\nThis pricing model is nice and predictable for the customer, but it makes it\nimpossible to justify a resell product. If CIVO charges 5€/month per vCPU, we\nwould need to charge extra to be profitable, which in turn overcuts the\ncompetition.\n\nWhen choosing Hetzner (or any other platform offering VMs), we are still able to\nundercut the competition and even optimize how the resources are laid out on\nthe nodes. The obvious downside of course being that we have to manage the\nclusters ourselves.\n\n## Share your thoughts\n\nReselling Kubernetes is tricky. I'm currently sketching out ideas for an\nalternative way to sell Kubernetes hosting at an ultra cheap price.
