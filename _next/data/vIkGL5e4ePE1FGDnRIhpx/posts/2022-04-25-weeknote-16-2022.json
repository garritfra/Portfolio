{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-04-25-weeknote-16-2022","markdownBody":"\nThis is my first (already belated) weeknote. Even though it's the monday of the\nnext week, I thought I'd reflect on what happened last week. I already tried [a\nsimilar format](/posts/2020-12-18-update-december) on this blog in a monthly\nfashion, but didn't stick to it. With these \"weeknotes\", I will try to sit down\nfor half an hour each friday. This is heavily inspired by [Doug Belshaw's posts\nwith the same name](https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/).\n\n## At work\n\nThere's currently an effort to integrate a whole new backend into our\napplication. Fundamental features like user- and role-management will have to be\nmigrated to this new backend, which is mostly incompatible with our current\none. As I'm currently the only developer on the project, building a concept\nand realizing it will mostly be my part. I'm somewhat frightened about this\nundertaking, but I think I will learn a whole lot.\n\nI also introduced versioned deployments for our application. To keep it simple,\nreleases are versioned by date (E.g. `v2022.04.21`). Alongside this, I also\nadded a changelog describing each release. I'm still unsure whether this gives\nus a benefit or if it's just unnecessary work, but time will tell. I'm curious\nof what you - the reader - thinks of this. Feel free to reply to this post via\nthe link at the bottom of the page.\n\n## On this blog\n\nI'm playing around with ideas about comments on this static website. I yanked\nout some thoughts in this thread, but I'll have to think about it a bit more:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://fosstodon.org/@garritfra/108180821665987615/embed\"\nclass=\"mastodon-embed\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border: 0; height: 21rem\" width=\"400\"\nallowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><script\nsrc=\"https://fosstodon.org/embed.js\" async=\"async\"></script>\n\n## Plants\n\nMy girlfriend and I are in love with plants. This week, we went to a nursery and\ngot ourselves a new member to our family: a Monstera Adansonii.\n\n![Monstera Adansonii](/assets/monstera_adansonii.jpeg)\n\nI also did a little experiment with one of my eucalyptus citriodoras. I cut it\nfrom 50cm back to the first \"node\" in the trunk, at about 2cm. I'm quite happy\nwith how it evolved in just about 10 months. It's now time to develop some\nbranches. Here's it before the pruning:\n\n![Eucalyptus before pruning](/assets/eucalyptus_before_pruning.jpeg)\n\nAnd this is what it looks like now:\n\n![Eucalyptus after pruning](/assets/eucalyptus_after_pruning.jpeg)\n\nI also made cuttings from the rest of the stem. Not sure if they'll survive, but\nwhat could I lose?\n\nThat's it for this week.
