{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2020-11-06-current-doings","markdownBody":"\nHi, I wanted to share some things I'm currently working on. Maybe I'll turn this into a monthly thing, who knows. :)\n\nOne major goal I set for myself in the upcoming months is to build a SaaS for freelancers. Some features of this will include handling clients, projects and expenses. A thing I'm struggeling with right now it to find a lightweight way to host it. It is currently deployable through docker containers, but I am not 100% satisfied with my current setup. I will give some updates on this in the future. I aim to release a very early alpha version for free soon, so that some people can stress test it extensively. For now, you can of course self-host it. I really don't want to impose subscription fees for it's users, but I will see how it goes. You can find the source code for it [here](https://github.com/garritfra/omega-crm).\n\nRecently, I increasingly gained interested in the [Gemini project](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/). In a nutshell, this is a very minimal alternative to HTTP, with a strong emphasis on simplicity. The maintainers clearly embrace a DIY mindset, which I want to follow. I set myself the rule to only interact with gemini using tools I wrote myself. To achive this, I am currently writing [my own Gemini server called \"Taurus\"](https://git.sr.ht/~garritfra/taurus) to eventually set up my own geminispace. I have not yet looked deeply into building a client, but I might do this once I'm happy with my server. I admit that I'm currently cheating a bit, by testing my server using a browser recommended by the gemini team ;)\nIf you are interested in this project, I highly recommend to check out the [gemini specification](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.html), and play around with some geminispaces. Maybe you could set up a server for yourself?\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Updates, November 2020","date":"2020-11-06","tags":"update, note, life"},"tags":["update","note","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-02-26-dive-log-phuket","frontmatter":{"title":"Dive Log: Phuket","date":"2024-02-26","tags":"note, life, diving, divelog"},"tags":["note","life","diving","divelog"]},{"slug":"2024-01-02-temporal-vs-fundamental-content","frontmatter":{"title":"Temporal vs. fundamental content","date":"2024-01-02","tags":"note, quote, life"},"tags":["note","quote","life"]},{"slug":"2023-12-30-2023-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2023 in Review","date":"2023-12-30","tags":"note, opinion, life, review"},"tags":["note","opinion","life","review"]},{"slug":"2023-12-18-overcoming-air-hunger","frontmatter":{"title":"Overcoming \"air hunger\"","date":"2023-12-18","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, life, til"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","life","til"]},{"slug":"2023-12-15-i-m-finally-off-coffee","frontmatter":{"title":"I'm finally off coffee","date":"2023-12-15","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
