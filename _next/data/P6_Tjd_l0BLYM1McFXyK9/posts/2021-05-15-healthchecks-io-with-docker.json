{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2021-05-15-healthchecks-io-with-docker","markdownBody":"\nI'm currently in the midst of improving the monitoring of my infrastructure. I\nmake heavy use of docker and docker-compose for my hosting, so it's vital to add\nmonitoring for most of the containers.\n\nI'm hosting my own instance of [healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io/).\nTheir solution to monitoring involves **you** having to ping **them**, instead\nof the other way around. This let's you add healthchecks to virtually anything\nthat can ping a http-endpoint.\n\ndocker-compose let's you define healthchecks to your config that, when\ncompleting sucessfully, mark the container as \"healthy\". The process of adding\nsuch a healthcheck is simple. First, create a new check in your healthchecks.io\naccount and set the ping interval to 1 minute, or a value you prefer. Then, add\nthis snippet to your docker-compose file:\n\n```yaml\napp:\n  image: nextcloud\n  ports:\n    - 127.0.0.1:8080:80\n  healthcheck:\n    test:\n      [\n        \"CMD\",\n        \"curl\",\n        \"-f\",\n        \"https://app-endpoint.tld\",\n        \"&&\",\n        \"curl\",\n        \"-fsS\",\n        \"-m\",\n        \"10\",\n        \"--retry\",\n        \"5\",\n        \"-o\",\n        \"/dev/null\",\n        \"https://healthchecks.io/ping/<UUID>\",\n      ]\n    interval: 60s\n    timeout: 10s\n    retries: 6\n```\n\nChange the first url to the url of your app. The second URL is the endpoint of\nyour healthchecks.io instance. You can obtain it from the check you configured\nearlier.\n\nThis configuration will try to ping your application and, if successful, notify\nthe healthcheck that the application is healthy. If the app is not reachable or\nthe container is down, the latter request will not be executed and your service\nis marked as \"down\".\n\nIn addition to the healthchecks of my docker containers, I also added basic\nhealthchecks to my servers cronfiles and its backup-commands.\n\nDo you have any suggestions regarding this topic?
