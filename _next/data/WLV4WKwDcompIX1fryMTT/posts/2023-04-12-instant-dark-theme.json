{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme","markdownBody":"\nThanks to [Jacksons](https://jacksonchen666.com/) [update to darktheme.club](https://github.com/garritfra/darktheme.club/pull/79), I just came across a neat little [CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) that turns a mostly CSS-free document into a pleasantly dark site:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n  color-scheme: light dark;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will adjust all elements on the page to the color scheme preferred by the user - without any other custom styles! ðŸ¤¯ It is also [widely supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_color-scheme) by browsers.\r\n\r\nI've always been quite dependent on CSS-frameworks for any project I'm starting. Going forward, I'd be interested to see how framework-less sites would feel using this property. If all else fails, there's always the awesome [simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) library, which you can slap on top of a raw document to make it pretty (and dark, if preferred) without using custom classes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 064 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Instant dark theme","date":"2023-04-12","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, learnings, web, css, til"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","learnings","web","css","til"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-12-19-another-reason-you-can-t-divide-by-zero","frontmatter":{"title":"Another reason why you can't divide by zero","date":"2023-12-19","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, til, math"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","til","math"]},{"slug":"2023-12-18-overcoming-air-hunger","frontmatter":{"title":"Overcoming \"air hunger\"","date":"2023-12-18","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, life, til"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","life","til"]},{"slug":"2023-12-12-roast-my-site","frontmatter":{"title":"Roast my Site!","date":"2023-12-12","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, meta, writing, web, random"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","meta","writing","web","random"]},{"slug":"2023-12-11-formula-e-is-essentially-mario-kart","frontmatter":{"title":"Formula E is essentially Mario Kart","date":"2023-12-11","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, til, random"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","til","random"]},{"slug":"2023-11-30-why-you-can't-divide-by-zero","frontmatter":{"title":"Why you can't divide by zero","date":"2023-11-30","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, til, math"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","til","math"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
