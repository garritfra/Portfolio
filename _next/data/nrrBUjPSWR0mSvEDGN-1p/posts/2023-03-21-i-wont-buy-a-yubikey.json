{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-03-21-i-wont-buy-a-yubikey","markdownBody":"\nI have a YubiKey that I use for work, and I love using it. But I won't get one for my personal life.\n\nI've been thinking about this for some time now, but I ultimately don't think the benefits outweigh the hassle of always carrying around another device that I risk losing or breaking.\n\nA Yubikey provides a very good second factor, but so does my phone. My phone, just like a Yubikey, is locked behind a third factor (a pin or biometric sensor), so my phone essentially *is* a Yubikey. You can argue that the authenticator app on my phone (bitwarden) can be hacked, but I'm willing to take that risk if it means I have to reset all security measures on all accounts if I lose the key.\n\nSo, I'm not getting a Yubikey.\n\n### Replies & Mentions\n\n- [Kev Quirk: re: I won't buy a YubiKey](https://kevquirk.com/i-wont-by-a-yubikey/)\n- [Alson Kaw: Why I won't use a YubiKey](https://alsonkaw.com/muses/why-i-wont-use-a-yubikey/)\n\n---\n\nThis is post 058 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"I won't buy a YubiKey","date":"2023-03-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, privacy, security, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","privacy","security","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-12-30-2023-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2023 in Review","date":"2023-12-30","tags":"note, opinion, life, review"},"tags":["note","opinion","life","review"]},{"slug":"2023-12-28-linkdump-2","frontmatter":{"title":"Linkdump #2","date":"2023-12-28","tags":"note, tech, programming, linkdump"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","linkdump"]},{"slug":"2023-12-22-10-000-hours","frontmatter":{"title":"10.000 Hours","date":"2023-12-22","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, learnings, books, tech, programming"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","learnings","books","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2023-12-21-notes-on-immutability","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on \"Immutability Changes Everything\"","date":"2023-12-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, note, learnings, review, tech, papers"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","note","learnings","review","tech","papers"]},{"slug":"2023-11-29-real-vs.-fake-trends","frontmatter":{"title":"Real vs. Fake Trends","date":"2023-11-29","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, quote, opinion, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","quote","opinion","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
