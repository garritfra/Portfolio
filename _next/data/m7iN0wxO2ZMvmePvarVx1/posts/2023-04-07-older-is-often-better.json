{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-04-07-older-is-often-better","markdownBody":"\nI'm guilty of buying shiny new things. After being unhappy with the Bluetooth connectivity in the OnePlus Nord I bought in december of 2020, I bought a brand new Pixel 7 last december. I told myself that t would be using the OnePlus Nord for at least three years, preferably four, yet I gave in after two years due to some issue that could have been fixed with a pair of cable-headphones. I'm now asking myself again: am I able to use my new Pixel 7 for more than 3 years?\n\nI just stumbled upon a blog post called \"[My long goodbye to Windows XP](https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/my-long-goodbye-to-windows-xp)\", in which the author explains that he is currently replacing his 2008 laptop running Windows XP with a \"new\" PC running Windows 7. He states that he knew the ins and outs of this operating system, so why switch to a new one? Eventually he did switch, but to an OS that is already end of life.\n\nI totally love this. If you're happy with what you got, you shouldn't let a new feature dictate how to change your workflow. Does one really need the features introduced in some software/hardware/tool in the past year? Wouldn't it make sense to use the things that have been battle-tested for at least a few years?\n\nAs I said, I'm very guilty of living at the cutting edge of technology. Maybe it's time to slow down. I'm certain it would simplify a lot of things.\n\n---\n\nThis is post 063 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Older is often better","date":"2023-04-07","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-12-01-field-notes-3","frontmatter":{"title":"Field Notes #3","date":"2023-12-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, notebooks"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","notebooks"]},{"slug":"2023-11-29-real-vs.-fake-trends","frontmatter":{"title":"Real vs. Fake Trends","date":"2023-11-29","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, quote, opinion, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","quote","opinion","tech"]},{"slug":"2023-11-20-re--writing-code-for-both-computers-and-humans","frontmatter":{"title":"re: Writing code for both computers and humans","date":"2023-11-20","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, opinion, web, javascript, tech, reply"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","opinion","web","javascript","tech","reply"]},{"slug":"2023-11-07-app-defaults","frontmatter":{"title":"My App Defaults (Late 2023)","date":"2023-11-07","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, fun, life, random"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","fun","life","random"]},{"slug":"2023-10-10-did-you-try-turning-it-off","frontmatter":{"title":"Did you try turning it off?","date":"2023-10-10","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","life"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
