{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-11-30-why-you-can't-divide-by-zero","markdownBody":"\nI've always been wondering why dividing by zero is considered undefined. My intuitive answer would have always been \"infinity\" or \"zero\". I just had a discussion about this with a collegue who happens to have a degree in mathematics, and the way they explained it made it absolutely clear why it doesn't make sense to divide by zero.\r\n\r\n## Inverse Operations\r\n\r\nBefore understanding why dividing by zero is undefined, you first need to know about inverse operations. It's quite simple!\r\n\r\nAn example: `3 + 2 = 5`. The inverse of addition is *subtraction*, so the inverse of this equasion is `5 - 2 = 3` or `5 - 3 = 2`.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to multiplication. The inverse of multiplation is *division*. So the inverse of `6 * 2 = 12` is `12 / 2 = 6` or `12 / 6 = 2`.\r\n\r\n## Dividing by zero\r\n\r\nLet's try to apply the inverse rule to the number zero, starting with addition. If `2 + 0 = 2`, then `2 - 0 = 2`.\r\n\r\nBut if we have `2 * 0 = 0`, the inverse of that would be `0 / 0 = 2`, which is just not true.\r\n\r\nDividing by zero breaks some fundamental laws of mathematics, which is why there's a general consensus that any equasion dividing by zero has no valid answer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 090 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Why you can't divide by zero","date":"2023-11-30","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, til, math"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","til","math"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-11-01-tracking-sqlite-database-changes-in-git","frontmatter":{"title":"Tracking SQLite Database Changes in Git","date":"2023-11-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech, sqlite"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech","sqlite"]},{"slug":"2023-10-13-organizing-multiple-git-identities","frontmatter":{"title":"Organizing multiple Git identities","date":"2023-10-13","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech"]},{"slug":"2023-08-23-so,-you-want-to-win-the-lottery","frontmatter":{"title":"So, you want to win the lottery","date":"2023-08-23","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, til, random"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","til","random"]},{"slug":"2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme","frontmatter":{"title":"Instant dark theme","date":"2023-04-12","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, learnings, web, css, til"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","learnings","web","css","til"]},{"slug":"2023-02-19-til-about-css-insets","frontmatter":{"title":"TIL about CSS Insets","date":"2023-02-19","tags":"web, note, til, quick-tip, css, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["web","note","til","quick-tip","css","100DaysToOffload"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
