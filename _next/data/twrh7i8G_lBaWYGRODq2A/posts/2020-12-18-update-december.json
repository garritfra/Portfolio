{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2020-12-18-update-december","markdownBody":"\nIt's christmas season! I hope you and your family are safe and sound. My main focus this month is to expand my knowledge about compilers, by [building one from scratch](https://sr.ht/~garritfra/sabre/). It's a compiler for a very simple language, but it gets the job done. So far, you can write [simple algorithms](https://git.sr.ht/~garritfra/sabre/tree/master/examples), and compile them to JavaScript. A more sophisticated C backend is in development, but I still need a plan for expanding the target-specific builtin functions to provide more features in the standard library. An important topic at the moment is the [documentation of the project](https://garritfra.github.io/sabre/). Since the compiler itself has gotten relatively stable, all the language-features now need to be captured and written down. There is also a [contributing guide](https://garritfra.github.io/sabre/developers/contributing.html), if you want to help out, or want to get into compiler design.\n\nStay home and stay safe!\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Updates, December 2020","date":"2020-12-18","tags":"update, note, life"},"tags":["update","note","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-04-01-toil","frontmatter":{"title":"Toil","date":"2024-04-01","tags":"note, life"},"tags":["note","life"]},{"slug":"2024-03-12-dive-log-vietnam","frontmatter":{"title":"Dive Log: Vietnam","date":"2024-03-12","tags":"note, life, diving, divelog"},"tags":["note","life","diving","divelog"]},{"slug":"2024-02-26-dive-log-phuket","frontmatter":{"title":"Dive Log: Phuket","date":"2024-02-26","tags":"note, life, diving, divelog"},"tags":["note","life","diving","divelog"]},{"slug":"2024-01-02-temporal-vs-fundamental-content","frontmatter":{"title":"Temporal vs. fundamental content","date":"2024-01-02","tags":"note, quote, life"},"tags":["note","quote","life"]},{"slug":"2023-12-30-2023-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2023 in Review","date":"2023-12-30","tags":"note, opinion, life, review"},"tags":["note","opinion","life","review"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
