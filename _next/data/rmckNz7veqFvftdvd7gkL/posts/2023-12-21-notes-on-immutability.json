Accountants don't use erasers or they go to jail.\r\n\r\nThe paper [Immutability Changes Everything](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper16.pdf) by Pat Helland talks about the trend towards immutability in data storage thoughout all layers of the stack. From append-only apps (Record changes, then derive the current state), down to how bits are stored on a hard drive (e.g. Copy on Write).\n\nI stumbled upon this paper through the [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/) collection. I was specifically looking for a paper that's short and easy to comprehend, since I don't have much experience in reading scientific papers. This is absolutely both short and easy to comprehend. If you're a beginner like me, I can highly recommend this one to you.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways:\r\n\r\n* Immutability enables clean replication\r\n* Change logs (e.g. [write-ahead logs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging)) are the source of truth. The database is a cache of a subset of those change logs\r\n* It's okay to consider violating [normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) rules to trade storage cost for read speed\r\n* Modern SSDs minimize wear by storing new versions of data to other blocks instead of mutating the data in place\r\n* The cost of immutability is increased storage\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 098 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on \"Immutability Changes Everything\"","date":"2023-12-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, note, learnings, review, tech, papers"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","note","learnings","review","tech","papers"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-04-11-a-simple-search-bar","frontmatter":{"title":"A simple search bar","date":"2024-04-11","tags":"guide, note, meta, web, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","meta","web","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2024-04-10-beating-elden-ring","frontmatter":{"title":"Beating Elden Ring","date":"2024-04-10","tags":"note, learnings, life, review, gaming"},"tags":["note","learnings","life","review","gaming"]},{"slug":"2024-04-04-pandoc-convert-links-to-footnotes-the-easy-way","frontmatter":{"title":"Pandoc: Convert links to footnotes (the easy way)","date":"2024-04-04","tags":"guide, note, writing, til, tech, programming, pandoc"},"tags":["guide","note","writing","til","tech","programming","pandoc"]},{"slug":"2024-04-02-fuck-trees-use-tags","frontmatter":{"title":"Fuck trees, use tags","date":"2024-04-02","tags":"note, opinion, tech"},"tags":["note","opinion","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-02-10-cosmic-horror-the-festival","frontmatter":{"title":"Cosmic Horror: The Festival","date":"2024-02-10","tags":"note, quote, writing, review, horror"},"tags":["note","quote","writing","review","horror"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
