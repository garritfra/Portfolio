For that, I apologize in advance!\n\nI'm planning to make two modifications. Firstly, I want to add a `id` property\nto all entries. So far, your reader has been likely been relying on the URL slug\nto identify an entry. Adding the `id` property makes this more flexible, but it\nalso means that your reader will think that there are new entries in the feed.\nThis will only happen once.\n\nSecondly, I want to reduce the amount of the entries. If you look at the\n[feed](/rss.xml), you'll see a lot of junk from way back, containing every word\nI wrote on this blog. Remember that this page is fetched periodically (usually\nevery hour for most readers) by **every** subscriber. That's a lot of traffic\nthat could be better put to use somewhere else. Not that it costs me anything -\nthis site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - but if this\nhelps reduce the carbon footprint of the site even by one gram, it's worth the\neffort.\n\nThat's all - just a heads up. Thanks for your patience, you're awesome! ✌️\n\n---\n\nThis is post 071 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
