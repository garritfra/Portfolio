{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-03-24-swapping-numbers-without-temp","markdownBody":"\nEver wondered how to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable?\n\nI just found this very old note that I thought is worth sharing. The trick is\nquite old and you might already know about this, but when I started out with\nprogramming, it blew my mind.\n\nIn school, we get taught to use a temporary\nvariable to swap two numbers:\n\n```js\nlet a = 5;\nlet b = 10;\n\nlet temp = a;\n\na = b; // a = 10\nb = temp; // b = 5\n```\n\nBut by using some arithmetic, we can save us a few bytes of memory:\n\n```js\nlet a = 5;\nlet b = 10;\n\na = a + b; // a = 15 ; b = 10\nb = a - b; // a = 15 ; b = 5\na = a - b; // a = 10 ; b = 5\n```\n\nPlease **never** use this in any production code. The less we have to think\nabout a piece of code, the better it is. It's a fun thought experiment\nnevertheless!\n\n---\n\nThis is post 026 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Swapping two Numbers without Temporary Variables","date":"2022-03-24","tags":"note, programming, 100DaysToOffload, tech"},"tags":["note","programming","100DaysToOffload","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-07-02-linkdump-llms","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ”— Linkdump: LLMs","date":"2024-07-02","tags":"note, tech, linkdump, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","linkdump","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-06-17-host-your-own-llm","frontmatter":{"title":"Host your own LLM","date":"2024-06-17","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, homelab, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","homelab","tech","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-06-03-i-just-cleaned-up-40-gb-of-brew-caches","frontmatter":{"title":"I just cleaned up 40 GB of Brew caches","date":"2024-06-03","tags":"guide, note, tech"},"tags":["guide","note","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
