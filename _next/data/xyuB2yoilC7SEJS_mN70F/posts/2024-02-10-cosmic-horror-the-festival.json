Cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly bodied, and evil the mind that is held by no head.\"\r\n>\r\n> â€” H.P. Lovecraft\r\n\r\nI loved reading [The Festival](https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/f.aspx) by H.P. Lovecraft, especially this quote by \"the mad Arab\" at the end of the story. The Festival is one of Lovecrafts first short stories in the [Cthulhu Mythos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos). The quote excellently shows the unique style of Lovecrafts short stories. Each story is a grotesque depiction of horrors that are beyond our imagination. I recently tried to replicate this style of writing in  \"[Haunted Memories](/posts/2023-09-10-short-story-haunted-memories)\", a short story about digital media. I'm just getting started with reading Lovecrafts stories, but the ones I read so far absolutely blew me away.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Cosmic Horror: The Festival","date":"2024-02-10","tags":"note, quote, writing, review, horror"},"tags":["note","quote","writing","review","horror"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-04-04-pandoc-convert-links-to-footnotes-the-easy-way","frontmatter":{"title":"Pandoc: Convert links to footnotes (the easy way)","date":"2024-04-04","tags":"guide, note, writing, til, tech, programming, pandoc"},"tags":["guide","note","writing","til","tech","programming","pandoc"]},{"slug":"2024-01-30-to-prove-something-is-true-try-disproving-it-first","frontmatter":{"title":"To prove something is true, try disproving it first","date":"2024-01-30","tags":"note, quote, practices, til, science"},"tags":["note","quote","practices","til","science"]},{"slug":"2024-01-06-a-better-publishing-workflow-for-static-blogs","frontmatter":{"title":"A better publishing workflow for static blogs","date":"2024-01-06","tags":"guide, note, meta, writing, web, github, tech"},"tags":["guide","note","meta","writing","web","github","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-01-05-greg-the-developer","frontmatter":{"title":"Greg, the Developer","date":"2024-01-05","tags":"note, tech, fun, shortstory, writing, programming, practices, devops"},"tags":["note","tech","fun","shortstory","writing","programming","practices","devops"]},{"slug":"2024-01-02-temporal-vs-fundamental-content","frontmatter":{"title":"Temporal vs. fundamental content","date":"2024-01-02","tags":"note, quote, life"},"tags":["note","quote","life"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
