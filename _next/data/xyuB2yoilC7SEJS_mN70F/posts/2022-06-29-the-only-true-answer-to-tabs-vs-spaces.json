{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-06-29-the-only-true-answer-to-tabs-vs-spaces","markdownBody":"\nI recently dove into a new project at work. We're starting from a blank page,\nso of course this classic question came up:\n\n> \"So should we use tabs or spaces for our formatting?\"\n\nOne of my teammates explained to us why the only logical answer to this is\n\"Tabs\", and you'll soon know why.\n\n## The problem\n\nMost formatters, by default, use either two or four spaces for indentation by\ndefault. The [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) formatter does this, and it\nsomewhat became the norm for JavaScript projects. This has one huge downside\nthough: everyone on the team has to agree, or live with this standard.\n\nNowadays, almost all editors come with the ability to change the preferred\nindentation settings, which will be overridden by the settings of the\nformatter. I prefer an indentation of 4 spaces, which is reflected in all of my\ncode. If I'm working on a project that uses an indentation of 2 spaces via\nprettier, my preference will be overridden when formatting the code.\n\n## Just use tabs\n\nThe solution to this problem is simple: Create a `.editorconfig` file and set\nthe indentation style to tab, without a width:\n\n```editorconfig\nroot = true\n\n[*]\nend_of_line = lf\ncharset = utf-8\nindent_style = tab\n```\n\nAlmost all editors will be able to pick this file up and configure some\nproject-wide settings. If your editor is configured to use a indent width of 4,\nthis setting will be respected. If you're a maniac that indents their code with\n8 spaces, you'll be pleased to see that you can finally use this style in your\ncode, without forcing anyone else to do as you do.\n\nEven GitHub, GitLab and friends are able to respect this setting, giving\neveryone the opportunity to view code in their preferred style.\n\nI hope you now know why using a single tab of indentation makes the most sense if\nyou're working in a team. Let me know your thoughts!\n\nThis is post 035 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"The only true answer to 'tabs vs spaces'","date":"2022-06-29","tags":"note, guide, 100DaysToOffload, programming, practices, tech"},"tags":["note","guide","100DaysToOffload","programming","practices","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-04-04-pandoc-convert-links-to-footnotes-the-easy-way","frontmatter":{"title":"Pandoc: Convert links to footnotes (the easy way)","date":"2024-04-04","tags":"guide, note, writing, til, tech, programming, pandoc"},"tags":["guide","note","writing","til","tech","programming","pandoc"]},{"slug":"2024-04-02-fuck-trees-use-tags","frontmatter":{"title":"Fuck trees, use tags","date":"2024-04-02","tags":"note, opinion, tech"},"tags":["note","opinion","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-01-30-to-prove-something-is-true-try-disproving-it-first","frontmatter":{"title":"To prove something is true, try disproving it first","date":"2024-01-30","tags":"note, quote, practices, til, science"},"tags":["note","quote","practices","til","science"]},{"slug":"2024-01-18-cost-per-request","frontmatter":{"title":"Cost per Request","date":"2024-01-18","tags":"infrastructure, aws, note, opinion, devops, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","aws","note","opinion","devops","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-01-06-a-better-publishing-workflow-for-static-blogs","frontmatter":{"title":"A better publishing workflow for static blogs","date":"2024-01-06","tags":"guide, note, meta, writing, web, github, tech"},"tags":["guide","note","meta","writing","web","github","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
