I identified 4 main \"levels\" of infrastructure abstraction:\r\n\r\n## Level 1: A website on a server\r\n\r\nThis is the most straight forward way to host a website. A webserver hosted on bare metal or a VM.\r\n\r\n## Level 2: Multiple servers behind a load balancer\r\n\r\nAt this stage, you start treating servers as cattle rather than pets. Servers may be spun up and down at will without influencing the availability of the application.\r\n\r\n## Level 3: An orchestrated cluster of servers\r\n\r\nInstead of a server serving a specific purpose (e.g. webserver, DB server, etc.), a server becomes a worker for arbitrary workloads (see Kubernetes, ECS).\r\n\r\n## Level 4: Multicluster service mesh\r\n\r\nIf an organization manages multiple clusters (e.g. multiple application teams), they can be tied together into a [service mesh](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/glossary/#service-mesh) to better optimize communication and observability.\r\n\r\n## Level 5: ???\r\n\r\nHistory shows that we never stop abstracting. Multicluster service meshes are about the most abstract concept many people (including myself) can comprehend, but I doubt that this is the end of this journey. So, what's next for modern infrastructure?\r\n\r\nThis is post 049 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"What's next for modern infrastructure?","date":"2023-02-21","tags":"note, infrastructure, kubernetes, 100DaysToOffload, tech"},"tags":["note","infrastructure","kubernetes","100DaysToOffload","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-04-02-fuck-trees-use-tags","frontmatter":{"title":"Fuck trees, use tags","date":"2024-04-02","tags":"note, opinion, tech"},"tags":["note","opinion","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-01-18-cost-per-request","frontmatter":{"title":"Cost per Request","date":"2024-01-18","tags":"infrastructure, aws, note, opinion, devops, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","aws","note","opinion","devops","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-01-06-a-better-publishing-workflow-for-static-blogs","frontmatter":{"title":"A better publishing workflow for static blogs","date":"2024-01-06","tags":"guide, note, meta, writing, web, github, tech"},"tags":["guide","note","meta","writing","web","github","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-01-05-greg-the-developer","frontmatter":{"title":"Greg, the Developer","date":"2024-01-05","tags":"note, tech, fun, shortstory, writing, programming, practices, devops"},"tags":["note","tech","fun","shortstory","writing","programming","practices","devops"]},{"slug":"2023-12-28-linkdump-2","frontmatter":{"title":"Linkdump #2","date":"2023-12-28","tags":"note, tech, programming, linkdump"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","linkdump"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
