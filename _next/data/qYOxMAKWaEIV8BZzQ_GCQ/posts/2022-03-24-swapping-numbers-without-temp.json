{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-03-24-swapping-numbers-without-temp","markdownBody":"\nEver wondered how to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable?\n\nI just found this very old note that I thought is worth sharing. The trick is\nquite old and you might already know about this, but when I started out with\nprogramming, it blew my mind.\n\nIn school, we get taught to use a temporary\nvariable to swap two numbers:\n\n```js\nlet a = 5;\nlet b = 10;\n\nlet temp = a;\n\na = b; // a = 10\nb = temp; // b = 5\n```\n\nBut by using some arithmetic, we can save us a few bytes of memory:\n\n```js\nlet a = 5;\nlet b = 10;\n\na = a + b; // a = 15 ; b = 10\nb = a - b; // a = 15 ; b = 5\na = a - b; // a = 10 ; b = 5\n```\n\nPlease **never** use this in any production code. The less we have to think\nabout a piece of code, the better it is. It's a fun thought experiment\nnevertheless!\n\n---\n\nThis is post 026 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Swapping two Numbers without Temporary Variables","date":"2022-03-24","tags":"note, programming, 100DaysToOffload, tech"},"tags":["note","programming","100DaysToOffload","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-04-02-fuck-trees-use-tags","frontmatter":{"title":"Fuck trees, use tags","date":"2024-04-02","tags":"note, opinion, tech"},"tags":["note","opinion","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-01-18-cost-per-request","frontmatter":{"title":"Cost per Request","date":"2024-01-18","tags":"infrastructure, aws, note, opinion, devops, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","aws","note","opinion","devops","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-01-06-a-better-publishing-workflow-for-static-blogs","frontmatter":{"title":"A better publishing workflow for static blogs","date":"2024-01-06","tags":"guide, note, meta, writing, web, github, tech"},"tags":["guide","note","meta","writing","web","github","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-01-05-greg-the-developer","frontmatter":{"title":"Greg, the Developer","date":"2024-01-05","tags":"note, tech, fun, shortstory, writing, programming, practices, devops"},"tags":["note","tech","fun","shortstory","writing","programming","practices","devops"]},{"slug":"2023-12-28-linkdump-2","frontmatter":{"title":"Linkdump #2","date":"2023-12-28","tags":"note, tech, programming, linkdump"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","linkdump"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
