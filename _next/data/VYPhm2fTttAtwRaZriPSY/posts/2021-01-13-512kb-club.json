{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2021-01-13-512kb-club","markdownBody":"\nJavaScript rules the web, literally. In fact, this website is built with JavaScript (Next.js). I recently started to think about if I really needed this much overhead for a simple site like this. After all, I don't have any fancy user interaction features or complex animation that would justify the JavaScript on this page.\n\nThere is a new (no, not that new) philosophy called [the lean web](https://leanweb.dev/). It essentially tries to keep websites tiny and semantically correct. This has many benefits, ranging from less pollution generated by your site to improved SEO, since many search engines favor a semantically correct website over a site that abuses JavaScript to mimic the features, that are baked into html anyway.\n\nIn order to get lean, I decided to join [the 512KB club](https://512kb.club/). This website lists sites that are below 512KB in total (uncompressed, with all dependencies). To get below that mark, I had to remove my face from the frontpage (I'm sure you'll miss itüòÖ), since the image itself was roughly 750KB. I'm now just below 500KB, which qualifies me to join the blue team.\n\n[![Blue Team](https://512kb.club/images/blue-team.svg)](https://512kb.club)\n\nI'm not planning to stop here though. I think keeping a website small and simple is an excellent practice. My next step will be to get rid of all the JS junk on this site and only rely on HTML and CSS. I still want to be able to write my posts in Markdown, so I will have to come up with a way to generate pages from them. A safe bet for this would be to use a SSG like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Frankly, [writing my own simple SSG probably wouldn't hurt either](https://erikwinter.nl/articles/2020/why-i-built-my-own-shitty-static-site-generator/). Let's see how high I can climb the ranks of the 512KB club.

For that, I apologize in advance!\n\nI'm planning to make two modifications. Firstly, I want to add a `id` property\nto all entries. So far, your reader has been likely been relying on the URL slug\nto identify an entry. Adding the `id` property makes this more flexible, but it\nalso means that your reader will think that there are new entries in the feed.\nThis will only happen once.\n\nSecondly, I want to reduce the amount of the entries. If you look at the\n[feed](/rss.xml), you'll see a lot of junk from way back, containing every word\nI wrote on this blog. Remember that this page is fetched periodically (usually\nevery hour for most readers) by **every** subscriber. That's a lot of traffic\nthat could be better put to use somewhere else. Not that it costs me anything -\nthis site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - but if this\nhelps reduce the carbon footprint of the site even by one gram, it's worth the\neffort.\n\nAs of the time of writing this post, by restricting the number of posts to 10,\nwe reduce the amount of traffic per client per hour from 272 kB down to to 24\nkB. That's over **2 GB** of traffic saved each year **per subscriber**!!\n\nThat's all - just a heads up.

This means that if you try to fetch a document that's *not* the index, for example `/foo`, the server will try to load the file with that name. \n\nBy nature, SPAs only consist of a single HTML entry point (`index.html` in most cases). It's responsible for routing the user to the correct page if there are multiple paths. And here's the crux: if the user tries to load `/foo`, he will not land at the SPA entry point. Instead, he will see a `404` error.\n\n## The solution\n\nA `404` response will automatically return a file called `404.html`, which we can use to our advantage. After building the application, simply copy the `index.html` to `404.html`, as demonstrated by [this commit](https://github.com/garritfra/sendpasswords.net/commit/66bdb68c229a3ac3386f7816a746155e658eb586). This will use `index.html` to serve the application on the root level, and `404.html` to load *the same app* if the page doesn't exist as a file. Whether the `index.html` is needed if there's already a `404.html` is up to you. I left it in to make clear that this is just a workaround.\n\nThis is a [well known](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69308662/9046809) workaround, but I wanted to bring some extra awareness to it, since it's a problem I ran into a couple of times so far.
