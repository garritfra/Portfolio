{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-06-29-the-only-true-answer-to-tabs-vs-spaces","markdownBody":"\nI recently dove into a new project at work. We're starting from a blank page,\nso of course this classic question came up:\n\n> \"So should we use tabs or spaces for our formatting?\"\n\nOne of my teammates explained to us why the only logical answer to this is\n\"Tabs\", and you'll soon know why.\n\n## The problem\n\nMost formatters, by default, use either two or four spaces for indentation by\ndefault. The [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) formatter does this, and it\nsomewhat became the norm for JavaScript projects. This has one huge downside\nthough: everyone on the team has to agree, or live with this standard.\n\nNowadays, almost all editors come with the ability to change the preferred\nindentation settings, which will be overridden by the settings of the\nformatter. I prefer an indentation of 4 spaces, which is reflected in all of my\ncode. If I'm working on a project that uses an indentation of 2 spaces via\nprettier, my preference will be overridden when formatting the code.\n\n## Just use tabs\n\nThe solution to this problem is simple: Create a `.editorconfig` file and set\nthe indentation style to tab, without a width:\n\n```editorconfig\nroot = true\n\n[*]\nend_of_line = lf\ncharset = utf-8\nindent_style = tab\n```\n\nAlmost all editors will be able to pick this file up and configure some\nproject-wide settings. If your editor is configured to use a indent width of 4,\nthis setting will be respected. If you're a maniac that indents their code with\n8 spaces, you'll be pleased to see that you can finally use this style in your\ncode, without forcing anyone else to do as you do.\n\nEven GitHub, GitLab and friends are able to respect this setting, giving\neveryone the opportunity to view code in their preferred style.\n\nI hope you now know why using a single tab of indentation makes the most sense if\nyou're working in a team. Let me know your thoughts!\n\nThis is post 035 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"The only true answer to 'tabs vs spaces'","date":"2022-06-29","tags":"note, guide, 100DaysToOffload, programming, practices"},"tags":["note","guide","100DaysToOffload","programming","practices"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-06-01-single-page-applications-on-github-pages","markdownBody":"\nMy latest project, [sendpasswords.net](https://sendpasswords.net/) is a [Single Page Application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) deployed on GitHub Pages.\n\nGitHub Pages is configured in a way to host static HTML files without any bells and whistles. This means that if you try to fetch a document that's *not* the index, for example `/foo`, the server will try to load the file with that name. \n\nBy nature, SPAs only consist of a single HTML entry point (`index.html` in most cases). It's responsible for routing the user to the correct page if there are multiple paths. And here's the crux: if the user tries to load `/foo`, he will not land at the SPA entry point. Instead, he will see a `404` error.\n\n## The solution\n\nA `404` response will automatically return a file called `404.html`, which we can use to our advantage. After building the application, simply copy the `index.html` to `404.html`, as demonstrated by [this commit](https://github.com/garritfra/sendpasswords.net/commit/66bdb68c229a3ac3386f7816a746155e658eb586). This will use `index.html` to serve the application on the root level, and `404.html` to load *the same app* if the page doesn't exist as a file. Whether the `index.html` is needed if there's already a `404.html` is up to you. I left it in to make clear that this is just a workaround.\n\nThis is a [well known](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69308662/9046809) workaround, but I wanted to bring some extra awareness to it, since it's a problem I ran into a couple of times so far. Happy SPAing!\n\n---\n\nThis is post 069 (nice) of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Single Page Applications on GitHub Pages","date":"2023-06-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, web, javascript, github"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","web","javascript","github"]},{"slug":"2023-05-19-work-batch-sizing","markdownBody":"\nI've been playing \n[Carcassonne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)) a lot with my girlfriend recently. It's a boardgame about building cities, roads and farms, and each completed \"project\" earns you some amount of points. The twist is that there's only a limited number of tiles, and once all tiles are used, the game is over unfinished projects are discarded.\n\nThe first couple of playthroughs I tried to maximize my score by increasing the number of projects I actively had going. I'd start a new city or road whenever I could, thinking that the multipliers you sometimes get would pay off in the end. Boy was I wrong.\n\nWhere I'm from, we have multiple sayings for this approach. \"Having too many irons in the fire\" or \"dancing on too many parties\". I was too busy starting new projects instead of making actual progress.\n\nA far better approach is to finish projects early, earning less points, but with a greater certainty that they will pay off. With every project you start, the likelyhood of the other projects paying off decreases.\n\nKeeping batch sizes small was a key concept of the [lean manufacturing movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) in the 1980s, and has since been adopted by the [DevOps movement](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) for the IT industry. If you want to learn more about this topic, you should check out [The DevOps Handbook](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-devops-handbook-second-edition/). It goes well beyond the basics of making IT processes more productive and efficient.\n\nAfter realizing that small batch sizes are the key to success, I haven't lost a game of Carcassonne since.

Create and download a full backup through the UI\r\n2. Flash Homeassistant onto the SSD\r\n3. Remove the SD card and plug the SSD into a USB 3.0 port of the Pi\r\n4. Boot\r\n5. Go through the onboarding procedure\r\n6. Restore Backup\r\n7. Profit\r\n\r\nIt worked like a charm! The speed has improved A LOT, and everything was set up as it should be. \r\n\r\n...Until we turned on the lights in the livingroom. My ZigBee-dongle, plugged into another USB port, wasn't able to communicate with the devices on the network.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging around, I came across several threads stating that an SSD over USB 3.0 apparently creates a lot of interference to surrounding hardware, including my ZigBee dongle. The fix was simple: either get an extension port for the dongle, or plug the SSD into a USB 2.0 port of the Pi. Since I didn't have an extension cord to get the dongle far away enough from the SSD, I went with the latter option for now. And that fixed it! The performance was much worse, but still better than the SD I used before. My next step will be to grab an extension cord from my parents. I'm sure they won't mind.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 066 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating Homeassistant from SD to SSD","date":"2023-04-27","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, homeassistant, homelab"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","homeassistant","homelab"]},{"slug":"2023-04-22-the-role-of-a-devops-engineer","markdownBody":"\nThe term \"DevOps\" can be interpreted in many different ways.
