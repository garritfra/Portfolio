In a nutshell, PGP is an encryption standard with a wide range of use cases. For quite some time, I didn't see the point of keeping a PGP keypair. It seemed like a burden to securely keep track of the key(s). Once you loose it, you will loose the trust of others. But after doing some research on the topic, I found that it's not actually that much of a hassle, while giving you many benefits.\n\n# The Why\n\nThe most obvious benefit is encrypting and decrypting messages and files. If you upload your public key, I can encrypt our private conversations. Nobody will be able to read what we're chatting about. If you fear that cloud providers will read through your documents, you can also go ahead and encrypt all of your data with your keypair.\n\nBut PGP is not just about encryption. A keypair also gives you a proof of identity. If I see that a piece of work is signed by you, I can be certain that you and only you have worked on this. By signing the keys of people we trust, we build a \"chain of trust\". A key with many signatures generally has a higher reputation than one without any signatures.\n\nTake Git commits for example. All it takes is a `git config user.email \"elon@spacex.com\"` and I can publish code under a different identity. But if everyone on the team signed their work, they will quickly see that a commit is missing its signature, because I'm simply not able to sign my work with Elon Musk's keypair. Only if they see a badge like this, they will know that they can trust it.\n\nYour keypair can also come in handy as a SSH key. Before I knew about PGP, I always had to install one key per machine I was working on. With PGP, you only have a single identity, and therefore you only have to install one key on your servers.\n\n# The How\n\nLet's first go over the process of setting up a keypair. For this, we will need the `gpg` command installed on our system. Usually, this is just a `<package manager> install gpg` away. Then, we will have to generate a keypair. The quickest way to get one is to use `gpg --gen-key`, but that will make some quirky assumptions about how you want to use your key.\n\nIn PGP, there is this concept of a **keyring**. A keyring has one master key and many subkeys. It is generally a good idea to have one fat master key that never expires and many small subkeys that last about a year or two. The benefit of structuring your keys like this is that you will always have your trusted keychain, and in case something goes south, E.g. your key gets compromised, you can replace that subkey and keep your identity.\n\nWith that in mind, let's create our master key. Run `gpg --full-gen-key` and follow the instructions. You probably want to use the `RSA and RSA (default)` option, and a key that is 4096 bits long (remember, this is the fat master key that never expires, so it must be secure). The comment can be left blank, unless you know what you are doing with that field. Enter a strong passphrase! If your private key were to get compromised, this passphrase is your last line of defense. Make it long, hard to crack but still rememberable. If everything went well, your key should be generated. Here's the full example output:\n\n```\nroot@c6acc9eb4fd1:/# gpg --full-gen-key\ngpg (GnuPG) 2.2.19; Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\nPlease select what kind of key you want:\n   (1) RSA and RSA (default)\n   (2) DSA and Elgamal\n   (3) DSA (sign only)\n   (4) RSA (sign only)\n  (14) Existing key from card\nYour selection? 1\nRSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.\nWhat keysize do you want?

Take the fingerprint of the key (that large number in the output) and run `gpg --edit-key --expert <your fingerprint>`. Run `addkey` three times to add these three keys:\n\n## Signing key\n\nThis key will be used to sign your work (git commits, tags, etc.).\n\n```\ngpg> addkey\n```\n\n1. Choose option \"RSA (set your own capabilities)\", which is currently number 8.\n1. Toggle E (Encryption) so the \"Current allowed actions\" only lists Sign and confirm with Q.\n1. Choose the keysize 2048 (or whatever you prefer).\n1. Choose the key expire date 1y (or whatever you prefer).\n1. Confirm twice, then enter your passphrase.\n\n## Encryption key\n\nThis key will be used to encrypt and decrypt messages.\n\n```\ngpg> addkey\n```\n\n1. Choose option \"RSA (set your own capabilities)\", which is currently number 8.\n1. Toggle S (Sign) so the \"Current allowed actions\" only lists Encryption and confirm with Q.\n1. Choose the keysize 2048 (or whatever you prefer).\n1. Choose the key expire date 1y (or whatever you prefer).\n1. Confirm twice, then enter your passphrase.\n\n## Authentication key\n\nThis key will be used for SSH authentication.\n\n```\ngpg> addkey\n```\n\n1. Choose option \"RSA (set your own capabilities)\", which is currently number 8.\n1. Toggle S (Signing), E (Encryption) and A (Authentication) so the \"Current allowed actions\" only lists Authenticate and confirm with Q.\n1. Choose the keysize 2048 (or whatever you prefer).\n1. Choose the key expire date 1y (or whatever you prefer).\n1. Confirm twice, then enter your passphrase.\n\nNow you should have one key per use case: signing, encrypting and authentication, each with an expiration date:\n\n```\nsec  rsa4096/C8E4854970B7A1A3\n     created: 2021-04-07  expires: never       usage: SC\n     trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate\nssb  rsa4096/C5F71423813B40A0\n     created: 2021-04-07  expires: never       usage: E\nssb  rsa2048/52D4D1D19533D8A5\n     created: 2021-04-07  expires: 2022-04-07  usage: S\nssb  rsa2048/072D841844E3F949\n     created: 2021-04-07  expires: 2022-04-07  usage: E\nssb  rsa2048/42E4F6E376DD92F6\n     created: 2021-04-07  expires: 2022-04-07  usage: A\n[ultimate] (1). Foo Bar <foo@bar.com>\n```\n\nSave your key, and optionally upload it to one of the many keyservers:\n\n```\ngpg> save\n\n$ gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org  --send-keys foo@bar.com\n```\n\n**Pro tip**: To set a default keyserver (I use `keys.opengpg.org`, but there are many others out there!), simply add it in your `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf` file:\n\n```\nkeyserver keys.openpgp.org\n```\n\nPeople can now import your public key via `gpg --keyserver keys.opengpg.org --search-keys foo@bar.com`.\n\nWe're done with the setup, let's put our keys to use!\n\n## Code Signing\n\nTo sign your code, you will have to tell git which key to use. Edit your global git options (`~/.gitconfig`) and add these fields:\n\n```\n[commit]\n\tgpgsign = true\n[tag]\n\tgpgsign = true\n[user]\n    name = Foo Bar\n\tsigningkey = 52D4D1D19533D8A5      # Use the ID of your signing key\n\temail = foo@bar.com\n```\n\nNow, whenever you add a commit, git will sign it with your key. You will have to let your git hosting provider know that this key is yours. Go to your account settings and look for a tab that says \"Manage (GPG) keys\". Where this tab is depends on your choice of service. Next, run `gpg --export --armor <your master key id>` and copy the resulting key into the input field of your git hosting service.\n\nWhenever you push a commit, its signature will be checked against that of your account. And that's all the magic!\n\n![A signed commit](/assets/signed_commit.png)\n\n## Encrypting messages\n\nIn order to send an encrypted message to someone, you will need his public key. There are numerous ways to obtain a public key of someone. The simplest way is to ask the person for the raw key. If it's in a text file, you can import it like so:\n\n```\ncat some_key.txt | gpg --import\n```\n\nOftentimes, people will store their keys on a keyserver, just like you have probably done it. To import someones key, simply search for it on a keyserver. I'll use my key here as an example.\n\n```\ngpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org  --search-keys garrit@slashdev.space\n```\n\nNow, your computer should know about my key. To verify that it's actually me you have imported, you can check if the output of `gpg --fingerprint garrit@slashdev.space` matches my actual fingerprint: `2218 337E 54AA 1DBE 207B 404D BB54 AF7E B093 9F3D`.\n\nOptionally, if you trust that the key is actually associated to me, you can sign it. This let's other people know that you trust me, which helps build a so called \"chain of trust\". A key which has been signed by many people is generally more trustworthy than one that has no signatures.\n\n```\ngpg --sign-key garrit@slashdev.space\n```\n\nNow, let's encrypt a message that only I will be able to read:\n\n```\nprintf \"If you can read this, you've successfully decrypted this message\" | gpg --encrypt --sign --armor -r garrit@slashdev.space\n```\n\nFeel free to send this message to my email-address, I'm happy to chat with you!\n\nDecrypting something is as easy as encrypting something. Say the encrypted message lives in `message.txt.asc`. If you are the recipient, all you have to do is to run `gpg --decrypt message.txt.asc`.\n\n## SSH\n\nYour PGP key can also be used as an SSH key to authenticate on your servers.\n\nFirst we need to add the following to `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` to enable SSH support in gpg-agent.\n\n```\nenable-ssh-support\n```\n\nNext, we'll need to tell gpg which key to use. We need to get the so called `keygrip` of your authentication key and add it to the `~/.gnupg/sshcontrol`. The keygrip can be obtained by running `gpg -K --with-keygrip`. Just copy the keygrip of the authentication key and paste it into the `~/.gnupg/sshcontrol` file.\n\nThen, we want the ssh agent to know where to look for the key. Put this in your `.bashrc` file (or corresponding config):\n\n```\nexport GPG_TTY=$(tty)\nexport SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)\ngpgconf --launch gpg-agent\n```\n\nThen, run `ssh-add -l` to load the key directly.\n\nTo get the public ssh key of your keypair, run this command:\n\n```\ngpg --export-ssh-key foo@bar.com\n```\n\nand add the output to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on your server. When signing in, you should be prompted to enter the passphrase of your key and then authenticated.\n\n## Closing thoughts\n\nI hope by now you see the benefits you gain from having a PGP keypair. Whether you find it useful enough to set one up is of course up to you. It is however a good practice to at least sign your git commits as a proof of identity. There are services like [Keyoxide](https://keyoxide.org) that let you keep a \"public record\" of your key, so that other people can verify your identity more easily. If you set up your key, let me know by sending an encrypted message!\n\nThis is post 016 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"A pretty good guide to pretty good privacy","date":"2021-04-07","tags":"privacy, guide, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["privacy","guide","100DaysToOffload"]},{"slug":"whom-do-you-trust","markdownBody":"\nNowadays, password managers are a necessity if you care even the slightest about your personal belongings on the interwebs. But think about it, do you really want to trust another company to store your most sensitive information?\n\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522251670181-320150ad6dab?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2566&q=80)\n\n##### TL;DR\n\nUse a **stateless** password manager like [LessPass](https://lesspass.com/) to access your password without relying on a third party to store your data.\n\n## Why use a password manager in the first place?\n\nHaving a single password for multiple accounts is convenient. What's also convenient, is **using** this password on multiple accounts once you have access to a single one. What might be convenient to you, might also be convenient to others. Many people, [especially celebrities](https://web.archive.org/web/20170225163642/http://uk.businessinsider.com/twitter-says-it-wasnt-hacked-passwords-reused-older-hacks-malware-to-blame-2016-6), fall victim to this trap of comfort.\n\nTo counteract this, people are (and should be) using different passwords for different accounts. These passwords differ in a single letter or digit (Twitter: `porridge4president`, GitHub: `poridge5president`, etc.), or they don't match at all (Twitter: `porridge4president`, GitHub: `YouWontGuessThisOne`).\n\nThe problem that most likely arises from this technique is called _password chaos_ ([Source](https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/password+chaos)):\n\n> _\"The confusion that arises when users have many unique passwords.\"_\n\nThe aim of a password manager is [to solve this problem by storing all of your passwords in a single place and securing it with an _ultra secure superpassword!_ (©)](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-use-password-manager-store-protect-yourself-hackers-lastpass-1password-dashlane-2017-2?r=DE&IR=T). This way, you can use arbitrary passwords - preferebly gibberish that doesn't make sense to humans (nor machines) - without losing them, as long as you have your _ultra secure superpassword!_ (©) - aka your masterpassword. The benefits are obvious: You get rid of the password chaos problem while staying relatively secure. Eventhough password managers are quite benificial, some people (including myself) see a catch in them.\n\n## Relying on a third party\n\nRelying on third party companies doesn't seem like a big deal. After all, you are probably using some form of cloud service to host your photos. Yet there's a lot of trust involved in letting others handle your private data, especially your passwords. In 2017, [a major password manager got hacked, exposing sensitive data including users and their passwords](https://www.zdnet.com/article/onelogin-hit-by-data-breached-exposing-sensitive-customer-data/). This shows the potential for security breaches in an application that inherently seemed safe. But what if I told you that there is an alternative to this? A password manager that does not store your data at all?\n\n## A Stateless password manager\n\nRecently, I stumbled across [LessPass](https://lesspass.com/#/). LessPass is a password manager that is very different from what I have seen so far. Instead of storing passwords that either you or a random password generator came up with, it computes passwords on the fly, given a website, username, your masterpassword and some options.\n\n![LessPass](../assets/lesspass.gif)\n\nThe key here is that LessPass uses a **pure function**, i.e. a function that given the same parameters will always give the same result. Using this technique, there's no need to store your password in a database owned by a large company, nor do you have to sync your passwords between your devices ([but there's an app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lesspass.android&hl=de)). The computation happens right on your machine, and **only** on your machine. If you want to find out more about how it works under the hood, you can check out [the authors blog post](https://blog.lesspass.com/lesspass-how-it-works-dde742dd18a4#.vbgschksh). He goes into great detail on what alorithm is used to compute your passwords and how to utilize every feature of LessPass.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBeing a little privacy nerd myself, I often think twice about what services I want to use, often even looking into self-hosted alternatives to major products. There are multiple products that offer self hosted solutions to store your passwords, however I also don't even trust _myself_ with such sensitive data either. LessPass eliminates the need to have a third party watch over your data, let alone to store it on their servers.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Whom do you trust?","date":"2020-03-17","tags":"security, privacy, note"},"tags":["security","privacy","note"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
