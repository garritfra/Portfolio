{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2021-02-02-bem-methodology","markdownBody":"\nIn the coming weeks, months and years, I will be working on frontend-development as part of my dayjob. These are some personal notes I took during my research about the BEM methodology. If you want to read the official introduction, you should visit [their website](http://getbem.com/).\n\n# Overview - What is BEM?\n\nBEMâ€Šâ€”â€ŠBlock Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in front-end development. It aims to group css-classes in a meaningful way, making it easier to understand\n\n1. where this class is used\n2. what it describes and\n3. what state the element is in.\n\nThe BEM-notation is divided into three main parts: Blocks, Elements and Modifiers.\n\n## Blocks\n\nA standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. Some examples might be **headers, containers, menus, inputs, checkboxes**, etc.\n\n## Elements\n\nA part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block. This could be a **menu item or an input placeholder**.\n\n## Modifiers\n\nA flag on a block or an element. Used to change appearance or behavior. This might be **disabled, checked, fixed, big**, etc.\n\n# Putting it together\n\nA block itself is referenced though its name.\n\n```css\n.button {\n}\n```\n\nTo reference elements inside of the block, you add it to the block element with two underscores (`__`):\n\n```css\n.button {\n}\n.button__text {\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to add a modifier to a block or an element, you separate it with two dashes (`--`):\n\n```css\n.button {\n}\n.button--disabled {\n}\n.button__text--inverted {\n}\n```\n\n# Benefits of BEM\n\n**Modularity**: Block styles never depend on one another. They can easily be moved to other parts of the app.\n\n**Reusability**: Composing styles in a meaningful way reduces the amount of code duplication.\n\n**Structure**: BEM gives your code a solid structure that is both easy to understand and to expand.\n\n# References\n\n- http://getbem.com/\n- https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/\n\nThis is post 009 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes about BEM (Block Element Modifier)","date":"2021-02-02","tags":"note, css, 100DaysToOffload, programming"},"tags":["note","css","100DaysToOffload","programming"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme","markdownBody":"\nThanks to [Jacksons](https://jacksonchen666.com/) [update to darktheme.club](https://github.com/garritfra/darktheme.club/pull/79), I just came across a neat little [CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) that turns a mostly CSS-free document into a pleasantly dark site:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n  color-scheme: light dark;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will adjust all elements on the page to the color scheme preferred by the user - without any other custom styles! ðŸ¤¯ It is also [widely supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_color-scheme) by browsers.\r\n\r\nI've always been quite dependent on CSS-frameworks for any project I'm starting.

Every line in a Dockerfile will generate a\nnew image that builds on top of the last one. This can be really handy if\nsomething is not right in your build.\n\nSince version 18.09 Docker has added a new backend for building images,\n[buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit#buildkit). Unfortunately, buildkit\ndoes not let you view the IDs of the intermediate containers it uses under the\nhood. To work around that, you can opt out of buildkit by running a build with\nbuildkit disabled:\n\n```sh\nDOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build --pull --rm -t myproject:latest .\n```\n\nYou should now see the IDs of the intermediate containers:\n\n```sh\nSending build context to Docker daemon  87.84MB\nStep 1/16 : FROM node:16.15.1-alpine3.16 AS development\n16.15.1-alpine3.16: Pulling from library/node\nDigest: sha256:c785e617c8d7015190c0d41af52cc69be8a16e3d9eb7cb21f0bb58bcfca14d6b\nStatus: Image is up to date for node:16.15.1-alpine3.16\n ---> e548f8c9983f\nStep 2/16 : WORKDIR /usr/src/app\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 34e5c9bdb910\nStep 3/16 : COPY package*.json ./\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 626e4ae998fc\nStep 4/16 : RUN npm install glob rimraf\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 2d036b8354e0\nStep 5/16 : RUN npm install\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 948709b4957f      <-- HERE\nStep 6/16 : COPY . .\n...\n```\n\nAs mentioned, these IDs are valid docker images, so you can just launch them\nand attach a shell like every other image:\n\n```sh\ndocker run -ti --rm 948709b4957f\n```\n\nIf you're not seeing a regular shell, but a Node.js REPL for example, this\nmight be because the `ENTRYPOINT` of that image was set to the binary of that\nREPL. To work around that, you can override the entrypoint:\n\n```sh\ndocker run -ti --rm --entrypoint=/bin/sh 948709b4957f\n```\n\n## When is this helpful?\n\nIf your build fails at a particular step, you can attach a shell to the **last\nworking** step, inspect the filesystem, and execute the failing command manually.\n\nThat's all!\n\nThis is post 039 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Debugging Docker images","date":"2022-09-30","tags":"note, 100DaysToOffload, guide, programming, docker"},"tags":["note","100DaysToOffload","guide","programming","docker"]},{"slug":"2022-06-29-the-only-true-answer-to-tabs-vs-spaces","markdownBody":"\nI recently dove into a new project at work. We're starting from a blank page,\nso of course this classic question came up:\n\n> \"So should we use tabs or spaces for our formatting?\"\n\nOne of my teammates explained to us why the only logical answer to this is\n\"Tabs\", and you'll soon know why.\n\n## The problem\n\nMost formatters, by default, use either two or four spaces for indentation by\ndefault. The [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) formatter does this, and it\nsomewhat became the norm for JavaScript projects. This has one huge downside\nthough: everyone on the team has to agree, or live with this standard.\n\nNowadays, almost all editors come with the ability to change the preferred\nindentation settings, which will be overridden by the settings of the\nformatter. I prefer an indentation of 4 spaces, which is reflected in all of my\ncode. If I'm working on a project that uses an indentation of 2 spaces via\nprettier, my preference will be overridden when formatting the code.\n\n## Just use tabs\n\nThe solution to this problem is simple: Create a `.editorconfig` file and set\nthe indentation style to tab, without a width:\n\n```editorconfig\nroot = true\n\n[*]\nend_of_line = lf\ncharset = utf-8\nindent_style = tab\n```\n\nAlmost all editors will be able to pick this file up and configure some\nproject-wide settings. If your editor is configured to use a indent width of 4,\nthis setting will be respected. If you're a maniac that indents their code with\n8 spaces, you'll be pleased to see that you can finally use this style in your\ncode, without forcing anyone else to do as you do.\n\nEven GitHub, GitLab and friends are able to respect this setting, giving\neveryone the opportunity to view code in their preferred style.\n\nI hope you now know why using a single tab of indentation makes the most sense if\nyou're working in a team. Let me know your thoughts!\n\nThis is post 035 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"The only true answer to 'tabs vs spaces'","date":"2022-06-29","tags":"note, guide, 100DaysToOffload, programming, practices"},"tags":["note","guide","100DaysToOffload","programming","practices"]},{"slug":"2022-03-24-swapping-numbers-without-temp","markdownBody":"\nEver wondered how to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable?\n\nI just found this very old note that I thought is worth sharing. The trick is\nquite old and you might already know about this, but when I started out with\nprogramming, it blew my mind.\n\nIn school, we get taught to use a temporary\nvariable to swap two numbers:\n\n```js\nlet a = 5;\nlet b = 10;\n\nlet temp = a;\n\na = b; // a = 10\nb = temp; // b = 5\n```\n\nBut by using some arithmetic, we can save us a few bytes of memory:\n\n```js\nlet a = 5;\nlet b = 10;\n\na = a + b; // a = 15 ; b = 10\nb = a - b; // a = 15 ; b = 5\na = a - b; // a = 10 ; b = 5\n```\n\nPlease **never** use this in any production code. The less we have to think\nabout a piece of code, the better it is. It's a fun thought experiment\nnevertheless!\n\n---\n\nThis is post 026 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Swapping two Numbers without Temporary Variables","date":"2022-03-24","tags":"note, programming, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["note","programming","100DaysToOffload"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
