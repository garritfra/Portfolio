{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-04-07-older-is-often-better","markdownBody":"\nI'm guilty of buying shiny new things. After being unhappy with the Bluetooth connectivity in the OnePlus Nord I bought in december of 2020, I bought a brand new Pixel 7 last december. I told myself that t would be using the OnePlus Nord for at least three years, preferably four, yet I gave in after two years due to some issue that could have been fixed with a pair of cable-headphones. I'm now asking myself again: am I able to use my new Pixel 7 for more than 3 years?\n\nI just stumbled upon a blog post called \"[My long goodbye to Windows XP](https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/my-long-goodbye-to-windows-xp)\", in which the author explains that he is currently replacing his 2008 laptop running Windows XP with a \"new\" PC running Windows 7. He states that he knew the ins and outs of this operating system, so why switch to a new one? Eventually he did switch, but to an OS that is already end of life.\n\nI totally love this. If you're happy with what you got, you shouldn't let a new feature dictate how to change your workflow. Does one really need the features introduced in some software/hardware/tool in the past year? Wouldn't it make sense to use the things that have been battle-tested for at least a few years?\n\nAs I said, I'm very guilty of living at the cutting edge of technology. Maybe it's time to slow down. I'm certain it would simplify a lot of things.\n\n---\n\nThis is post 063 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Older is often better","date":"2023-04-07","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-06-25-make-a-list","markdownBody":"\nMy dad taught me this important lesson. \n\nWhenever you're feeling stuck or you don't know what to do, make a list. The next step will often become clear.\n\nWhether you're going shopping or you're feeling mentally overloaded. It helps to write down your thoughts in an actionable form. I don't care if it's in some fancy mobile app or on a napkin. Just make a list.\n\nLists are the answer to almost anything. And where they're not, a spreadsheet is.\n\n---\n\nThis is post 070 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Make a List","date":"2023-06-25","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life"]},{"slug":"2023-05-19-work-batch-sizing","markdownBody":"\nI've been playing \n[Carcassonne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)) a lot with my girlfriend recently. It's a boardgame about building cities, roads and farms, and each completed \"project\" earns you some amount of points. The twist is that there's only a limited number of tiles, and once all tiles are used, the game is over unfinished projects are discarded.\n\nThe first couple of playthroughs I tried to maximize my score by increasing the number of projects I actively had going. I'd start a new city or road whenever I could, thinking that the multipliers you sometimes get would pay off in the end. Boy was I wrong.\n\nWhere I'm from, we have multiple sayings for this approach. \"Having too many irons in the fire\" or \"dancing on too many parties\". I was too busy starting new projects instead of making actual progress.\n\nA far better approach is to finish projects early, earning less points, but with a greater certainty that they will pay off. With every project you start, the likelyhood of the other projects paying off decreases.\n\nKeeping batch sizes small was a key concept of the [lean manufacturing movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) in the 1980s, and has since been adopted by the [DevOps movement](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) for the IT industry. If you want to learn more about this topic, you should check out [The DevOps Handbook](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-devops-handbook-second-edition/). It goes well beyond the basics of making IT processes more productive and efficient.\n\nAfter realizing that small batch sizes are the key to success, I haven't lost a game of Carcassonne since.

Some times I want to write about every thought that crosses my mind, leading to 4+ average- to low-quality posts a week. I think I'm in one of these phases right now.\n\nSome other times, I feel like most of my thoughts are not worth the effort to write about, but the ones that I **do** write about, often become the ones that I'm [most](/posts/2021-04-07-pgp-guide) [proud](/posts/2021-10-04-server-side-caching-with-apollo-graphql) [of](/posts/2021-01-18-reasons-the-fediverse-is-better).\n\nThese phases act like opposing forces that coexist very well. Pumping out more thoughts of lesser quality frees up my mind for higher quality ones, and when I'm writing about higher quality thoughts, I get the urge to write more often, completing the circuit.\n\nIn the end, it's not about **what** you write about, but about the process of writing itself.
