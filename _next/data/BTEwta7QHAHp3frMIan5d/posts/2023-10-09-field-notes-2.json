You may view my [About My Pocket Notebook](/posts/2023-09-09-everyday-carry-notebooks) post as part one of this series, since I wrote it near the end of my first notebook. I think it would be interesting to share my experience with this each notebook. One day I'll maybe have a nice history of posts that I can look back at. ðŸ™‚\n\nThis notebook lasted from 2023-09-10 to 2023-10-09, roughly one month. Here's a picture of it, after living in my back pocket every single day:\n\n![Field Notes #2](/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_2.jpeg)\n\n### What's in it?\n\nI used this notebook as a todo list, a travel journal, quick sketches, braindumps, simple calculations and much more. It's become a place to dump thoughts whenever and wherever I want to. Sometimes, it's genuinely interesting facts, like how to find north when all you have is a clear night sky.\n\n![Notes on how to find north at night](/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_2_page_5.jpeg)\n\nAnd sometimes it's just a random collection of uninteresting thoughts that wouldn't leave my head.\n\n![Random collection of notes](/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_2_page_32.jpeg)\n\nSome of these notes may mature into a project or blog post, like [the second to last note on that page](/posts/2023-09-29-undo-on-mobile-phones), while others just fade into the abyss. But that's okay! The point is to get these thoughts out of my head to work with them more easily.\n\n### What's next?\n\nI'll keep on writing! I got a bunch of new FIELD NOTES notebooks to fill up. Since my next notebook will likely live with me through the halloween season, I opted for the [Harvest](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/harvest) edition as my next notebook. ðŸŽƒ\n\n![Field Notes #3](/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_3.jpeg)\n\nI'm curious to see where this one takes me.\n\n---\n\nThis is post 081 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).","frontmatter":{"title":"Field Notes #2","date":"2023-10-09","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, notebooks"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","notebooks"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-10-01-the-mind-rope-experiment","frontmatter":{"title":"The Mind Rope Experiment","date":"2023-10-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life"]},{"slug":"2023-09-09-everyday-carry-notebooks","frontmatter":{"title":"About My Pocket Notebook","date":"2023-09-09","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, notebooks"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","notebooks"]},{"slug":"2023-08-23-so,-you-want-to-win-the-lottery","frontmatter":{"title":"So, you want to win the lottery","date":"2023-08-23","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, til, random"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","til","random"]},{"slug":"2023-06-25-make-a-list","frontmatter":{"title":"Make a List","date":"2023-06-25","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life"]},{"slug":"2023-05-19-work-batch-sizing","frontmatter":{"title":"Optimizing work batch size","date":"2023-05-19","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, learnings, life, devops"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","learnings","life","devops"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
