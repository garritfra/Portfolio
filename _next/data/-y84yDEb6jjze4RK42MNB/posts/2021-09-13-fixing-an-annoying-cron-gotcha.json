{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2021-09-13-fixing-an-annoying-cron-gotcha","markdownBody":"\nA while ago I went through my server and reworked my [storage\nsetup](/posts/2021-02-07-storage-setup). As discribed in that blog post, I set\nup daily backups to [Backblaze\nB2](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage) using their amazing CLI\nthrough a cron script. A day went by and I noticed that the\n[healthcheck](/posts/2021-05-15-healthchecks-io-with-docker) didn't pass.\nUnfortunately I didn't have time to fix this problem immediately, so instead I\nexecuted the command by hand every couple of days. One could argue that this in\ntotal took way more time than the actual fix, but hey, I was lazy. In the end,\nI finally dedicated some time to fix this annoying issue.\n\nIt turns out that a command executed by cron doesn't run through sh or bash,\nbut in a minimal environment without your usual environment-variables. As a\nresult, my `b2` command (and many other commands for that matter) won't run as\nexpected, if at all. A quick fix is to run your command through bash or sh\nexplicitly:\n\n```sh\nsh -c \"mycommand\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want all your entries to use sh or bash, you can set the\n`SHELL` variable at the very beginning of your crontab:\n\n```sh\nSHELL=/bin/bash\n\n15 1 * * * some_command\n```\n\n[Here](https://askubuntu.com/a/23438) is an answer that goes into more detail\nabout this. Have a great day!\n\nThis is post 019 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Finally fixing that annoying Cron gotcha","date":"2021-09-13","tags":"linux, guide, 100DaysToOffload, homelab"},"tags":["linux","guide","100DaysToOffload","homelab"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-11-01-tracking-sqlite-database-changes-in-git","frontmatter":{"title":"Tracking SQLite Database Changes in Git","date":"2023-11-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech, sqlite"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech","sqlite"]},{"slug":"2023-10-13-organizing-multiple-git-identities","frontmatter":{"title":"Organizing multiple Git identities","date":"2023-10-13","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech"]},{"slug":"2023-06-01-single-page-applications-on-github-pages","frontmatter":{"title":"Single Page Applications on GitHub Pages","date":"2023-06-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, web, javascript, github"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","web","javascript","github"]},{"slug":"2023-04-27-migrating-homeassistant-from-sd-to-ssd","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating Homeassistant from SD to SSD","date":"2023-04-27","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, homeassistant, homelab"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","homeassistant","homelab"]},{"slug":"2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme","frontmatter":{"title":"Instant dark theme","date":"2023-04-12","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, learnings, web, css, til"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","learnings","web","css","til"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
