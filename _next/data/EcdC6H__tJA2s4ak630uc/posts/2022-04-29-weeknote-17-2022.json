{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-04-29-weeknote-17-2022","markdownBody":"\nThis week was quite ordinary. We enjoyed the weather during walks in the park\nand got some chores done.\n\n## At work\n\nA major news this week was that GitLab decided to remove [certificate-based\ncluster\naccess](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/deploy_to_cluster.html#deploy-to-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-cluster-certificates-deprecated)\nto Kubernetes clusters sooner as we hoped. We're now fleshing out how to migrate\nto the newer\n[gitlab-agent](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/install/index.html).\n\nI also got some refactoring work done. In one of our projects, we're currently\nmigrating our GraphQL queries away from a HOC-pattern towards React hooks, using\nthe amazing\n[apollo-augmented-hooks](https://github.com/appmotion/apollo-augmented-hooks)\nlibrary for additional caching features.\n\n## Sideprojects\n\nI continued to work on a secret side-project of mine, but I don't want to spoil\nanything just yet.\n\nBUT! If you're good at writing and would like to help out writing a couple of\nparagraphs that can catch the users attention, [I'd love to hear from\nyou](/contact).\n\nThat's it for this week. Thanks for reading!\n\nThis is post 029 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Weeknote 17/2022","date":"2022-04-29","tags":"weeknote, 100DaysToOffload, life"},"tags":["weeknote","100DaysToOffload","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-03-12-dive-log-vietnam","frontmatter":{"title":"Dive Log: Vietnam","date":"2024-03-12","tags":"note, life, diving, divelog"},"tags":["note","life","diving","divelog"]},{"slug":"2024-02-26-dive-log-phuket","frontmatter":{"title":"Dive Log: Phuket","date":"2024-02-26","tags":"note, life, diving, divelog"},"tags":["note","life","diving","divelog"]},{"slug":"2024-01-02-temporal-vs-fundamental-content","frontmatter":{"title":"Temporal vs. fundamental content","date":"2024-01-02","tags":"note, quote, life"},"tags":["note","quote","life"]},{"slug":"2023-12-30-2023-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2023 in Review","date":"2023-12-30","tags":"note, opinion, life, review"},"tags":["note","opinion","life","review"]},{"slug":"2023-12-18-overcoming-air-hunger","frontmatter":{"title":"Overcoming \"air hunger\"","date":"2023-12-18","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, life, til"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","life","til"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
