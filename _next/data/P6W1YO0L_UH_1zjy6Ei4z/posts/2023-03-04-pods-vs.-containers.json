I found a [great article](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-vs-pods/) going over the differences of the two terms.\r\n\r\n> Containers and Pods are alike. Under the hood, they heavily rely on Linux namespaces and cgroups. However, Pods aren't just groups of containers. A Pod is a self-sufficient higher-level construct. All pod's containers run on the same machine (cluster node), their lifecycle is synchronized, and mutual isolation is weakened to simplify the inter-container communication. This makes Pods much closer to traditional VMs, [bringing back the familiar deployment patterns like sidecar or reverse proxy](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/multi-container-pods-and-container-communication-in-kubernetes/).\r\n\r\nIn my own words: Containers are made up of Linux namespaces and cgroups. Pods can be thought of as a cgroup of cgroups (though not really), mimicing the behavior of a virtual machine that runs multiple containers with a synchronized lifecycle. The containers in a pod are losely isolated, making it easy to communicate between each other. Containers in a pod can however set individual resource requests, enabled by Linux namespaces.\r\n\r\nI'd highly encourage you to check out [the original article](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-vs-pods/) if you want to learn more about this topic.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 053 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Pods vs. Containers","date":"2023-03-04","tags":"note, kubernetes, infrastructure, docker, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["note","kubernetes","infrastructure","docker","100DaysToOffload"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-12-21-notes-on-immutability","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on \"Immutability Changes Everything\"","date":"2023-12-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, note, learnings, review, tech, papers"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","note","learnings","review","tech","papers"]},{"slug":"2023-04-28-serverless-framework-retrospective","frontmatter":{"title":"Serverless Framework Retrospective","date":"2023-04-28","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, note, terraform, learnings, devops, serverless"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","note","terraform","learnings","devops","serverless"]},{"slug":"2023-03-30-designing-resilient-cloud-infrastructure","frontmatter":{"title":"Designing resilient cloud infrastructure","date":"2023-03-30","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, guide, note, learnings"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","guide","note","learnings"]},{"slug":"2023-03-16-terraform-project-learnings","frontmatter":{"title":"Terraform project learnings","date":"2023-03-16","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, note, terraform, learnings"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","note","terraform","learnings"]},{"slug":"2023-03-10-debugging-ecs-tasks","frontmatter":{"title":"Debugging ECS Tasks","date":"2023-03-10","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, guide, note, terraform"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","guide","note","terraform"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
