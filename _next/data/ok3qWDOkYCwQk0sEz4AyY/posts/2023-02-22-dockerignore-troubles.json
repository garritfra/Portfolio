{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-02-22-dockerignore-troubles","markdownBody":"\r\nI commonly used to create a `.Dockerignore` file next to my `Dockerfile`. After countless hours of ignoring the problems in my setup, I found out that the uppercase `.Dockerignore` doesn't get picked up by Docker on MacOS. Only the lowercase `.dockerignore` is valid.\r\n\r\nI didn't find official documentation on this, but I think it's because both MacOS and Linux are case-sensitive, while Windows isn't. I don't remember why I got used to the `.Dockerignore` convention, but I swear I saw someone using it in the wild. Or it's my (un)logical reasoning that, because `Dockerfile` is uppercased, `.Dockerignore` should be uppercased as well.\r\n\r\nEither way, stay away from `.Dockerfile`s and stick to `.dockerfile`s.\r\n\r\nThis is post 050 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Dockerignore troubles","date":"2023-02-22","tags":"note, docker, web"},"tags":["note","docker","web"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-11-20-re--writing-code-for-both-computers-and-humans","frontmatter":{"title":"re: Writing code for both computers and humans","date":"2023-11-20","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, opinion, web, javascript, tech, reply"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","opinion","web","javascript","tech","reply"]},{"slug":"2023-06-01-single-page-applications-on-github-pages","frontmatter":{"title":"Single Page Applications on GitHub Pages","date":"2023-06-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, web, javascript, github"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","web","javascript","github"]},{"slug":"2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme","frontmatter":{"title":"Instant dark theme","date":"2023-04-12","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, learnings, web, css, til"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","learnings","web","css","til"]},{"slug":"2023-03-04-pods-vs.-containers","frontmatter":{"title":"Pods vs. Containers","date":"2023-03-04","tags":"note, kubernetes, infrastructure, docker, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["note","kubernetes","infrastructure","docker","100DaysToOffload"]},{"slug":"2023-03-03-notes-on-containerizing-php-applications","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on containerizing PHP applications","date":"2023-03-03","tags":"note, infrastructure, docker, php, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["note","infrastructure","docker","php","100DaysToOffload"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
