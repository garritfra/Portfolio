If you think that one bit is enough to store this information, you'd be wrong.\n\nIn order to keep the binary layout of a program simple and convenient, most languages store information in 8 bit (1 byte) blocks.\nIf you allocate a `bool` in Rust or (most) other languages that are based on LLVM, [it will take up 1 `i1`, or 1 byte of memory](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#simple-constants). If you allocate a boolean value in C, you will get [an integer constant with a value of either 1 or 0](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/stdbool.h.html).\n\nIf you find yourself having to store multiple boolean states somewhere, you might simply declare those booleans and call it a day:\n\n```c\n#include <stdbool.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n    bool can_read = true;\n    bool can_write = true;\n    bool can_execute = false;\n\n    if (can_read)\n        printf(\"read bit set\\n\");\n    if (can_write)\n        printf(\"write bit set\\n\");\n    if (can_execute)\n        printf(\"execute bit set\\n\");\n\n    // Output:\n    // read bit set\n    // write bit set\n}\n```\n\n## We can do better than this\n\nAn alternative approach to store boolean values is to share a \"chunk\" of bits with other values. This is usually done using bitwise operations:\n\n```c\n#include <stdbool.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Define permissions\n#define PERM_NONE       0b000\n#define PERM_READ       0b001\n#define PERM_WRITE      0b010\n#define PERM_EXECUTE    0b100\n\n#define PERM_ALL        PERM_READ | PERM_WRITE | PERM_EXECUTE\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Allocate 1 byte for permissions\n    char permissions = PERM_READ | PERM_WRITE;\n\n    if (permissions & PERM_READ)\n        printf(\"write bit set\\n\");\n    if (permissions & PERM_WRITE)\n        printf(\"read bit set\\n\");\n    if (permissions & PERM_EXECUTE)\n        printf(\"execute bit set\\n\");\n\n    // Output:\n    // read bit set\n    // write bit set\n}\n```\n\nThis example still wastes 5 bits since we only use 3 out of 8 possible bits of the char type, but I'm sure you get the point. Allocating 3 boolean values independently would waste 7 \\* 3 = 21 bits, so it's a massive improvement. Whenever you find yourself needing multiple boolean values, think twice if you can use this pattern.\n\nMicrocontrollers have a very constrainted environment, therefore bitwise operations are essential in those scenarios. 7 wasted bits are a lot if there are only 4 kb of total memory available. For larger systems we often forget about these constraints, until they add up.\n\n## My Plea\n\n- Be mindful about the software you create.\n- Appreciate the resources at your disposal.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Booleans are wasted memory","date":"2020-11-17","tags":"note, guide, programming, tech"},"tags":["note","guide","programming","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-01-18-cost-per-request","frontmatter":{"title":"Cost per Request","date":"2024-01-18","tags":"infrastructure, aws, note, opinion, devops, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","aws","note","opinion","devops","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-01-06-a-better-publishing-workflow-for-static-blogs","frontmatter":{"title":"A better publishing workflow for static blogs","date":"2024-01-06","tags":"guide, note, meta, writing, web, github, tech"},"tags":["guide","note","meta","writing","web","github","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-01-05-greg-the-developer","frontmatter":{"title":"Greg, the Developer","date":"2024-01-05","tags":"note, tech, fun, shortstory, writing, programming, practices, devops"},"tags":["note","tech","fun","shortstory","writing","programming","practices","devops"]},{"slug":"2023-12-28-linkdump-2","frontmatter":{"title":"Linkdump #2","date":"2023-12-28","tags":"note, tech, programming, linkdump"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","linkdump"]},{"slug":"2023-12-22-10-000-hours","frontmatter":{"title":"10.000 Hours","date":"2023-12-22","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, learnings, books, tech, programming"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","learnings","books","tech","programming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
