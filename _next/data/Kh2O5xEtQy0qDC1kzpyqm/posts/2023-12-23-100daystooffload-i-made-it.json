These last couple of days, I've been sprinting towards the finish line with one post every day to finish the challenge until the end of the year. And I finally made it!\n\nI started this challenge with [this](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2021-01-11-100daystooffload) post on January 11th, 2021, which means it took me almost three full years to finish it. The original challenge was to write 100 posts in **one** year, so I'm way overdue. ðŸ˜… But that doesn't make me less proud to finish it!\n\nIf you're interested, you can find the list of all 100 of my posts [here](https://garrit.xyz/posts?tags=100DaysToOffload).\n\n## What I learned\n\nBefore starting this challenge, I sometimes struggled with putting out content on this blog. It felt like each post had to be perfect, and if it wasn't, I was scared to publish it.\n\nThe idea of #100DaysToOffload is to let go of this fear and *Just. Write.* This absolutely worked. I accepted the fact that not every post is perfect and [sometimes posting more often with worse quality makes way for better posts](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-04-01-quality-vs.-quantity).\n\nIn order to post more often, I also found ways to reduce the friction between me writing a text and publishing it to the blog. I've yet to cover this in a post, but I built myself [a handy script](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish_via_issue.yaml) that turns the contents of a GitHub issue into a pull request, ready to be merged as a blog post. This enables me to write posts everywhere I want (like the one right now, which is written on my phone), instead of having to open my laptop, create a new file, write the post and commit it to the repository.\n\n## What's next?\n\nI will continue posting when I feel like it! I set myself the goal to publish at least 50 posts a year, but that's just a rough estimate. If I don't feel like blogging, I won't force myself to do it.\n\nAll in all, I'm very thankful for having taken part in this challenge. I met [a](https://kevquirk.com/) [bunch](https://joelchrono.xyz/) [of](https://claytonerrington.com/) [like-minded](https://dougbelshaw.com/) [folks](https://jlelse.blog/) that are happy to discuss whatever I'm rambling about, and it's great to read whatever they are rambling about as well! I'm also thankful for all the nuggets of information I got to share with you, and also with my future self (seriously, you won't believe how often I'm looking up old posts and being happy that I wrote that down!).\n\nThanks for reading, until next time!\n\n---\n\nThis is post 100 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"#100DaysToOffload: I made it!","date":"2023-12-23","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, learnings, meta, writing"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","learnings","meta","writing"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-04-10-beating-elden-ring","frontmatter":{"title":"Beating Elden Ring","date":"2024-04-10","tags":"note, learnings, life, review, gaming"},"tags":["note","learnings","life","review","gaming"]},{"slug":"2024-04-07-five-years-of-blogging","frontmatter":{"title":"Five Years of Blogging","date":"2024-04-07","tags":"note, books, writing, meta"},"tags":["note","books","writing","meta"]},{"slug":"2024-04-04-pandoc-convert-links-to-footnotes-the-easy-way","frontmatter":{"title":"Pandoc: Convert links to footnotes (the easy way)","date":"2024-04-04","tags":"guide, note, writing, til, tech, programming, pandoc"},"tags":["guide","note","writing","til","tech","programming","pandoc"]},{"slug":"2024-02-10-cosmic-horror-the-festival","frontmatter":{"title":"Cosmic Horror: The Festival","date":"2024-02-10","tags":"note, quote, writing, review, horror"},"tags":["note","quote","writing","review","horror"]},{"slug":"2024-01-06-a-better-publishing-workflow-for-static-blogs","frontmatter":{"title":"A better publishing workflow for static blogs","date":"2024-01-06","tags":"guide, note, meta, writing, web, github, tech"},"tags":["guide","note","meta","writing","web","github","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
