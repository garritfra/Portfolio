I just found out there's a a way to switch the terminal into fullscreen mode, using the \"View: Toggle Maximized Panel\" command.\r\n\r\nYou can bind it to a shortcut, which makes switching between editor and terminal a breeze! Simply add this to your `keybindings.json` (also accessible via the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette)):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    {\r\n        \"key\": \"cmd+alt+m\",\r\n        \"command\": \"workbench.action.toggleMaximizedPanel\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n- [Original StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48512128/9046809)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 059 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
