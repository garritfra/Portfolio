However, it\nhas some really annoying problems that don't seem to get attention by Apple.\nThis is a list of things that personally bother me. I will try to update it\nwhenever I encounter new issues.\n\n- ~~When plugging in a external monitor, some native Windows can't be used with a\n  mouse anymore. Restart required to fix.~~ (This seems to be fixed)\n- Dash-to-dock sometimes doesn't work for fullscreen-applications.\n- When opening a fullscreen window from the workspace-overview, the dock\n  sometimes stays visible. Has to be manually hovered to hide.\n- When using a chromium-based browser on an external monitor in\n  fullscreen-mode, the menu-bar sometimes doesn't appear when hovered.\n- When switching from the internal to an external monitor, the workspace\n  alignment is not how I left it.\n\nThis is post 034 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"A list of bugs in MacOS","date":"2022-06-14","tags":"note, 100DaysToOffload, MacOS, tech"},"tags":["note","100DaysToOffload","MacOS","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-01-05-greg-the-developer","frontmatter":{"title":"Greg, the Developer","date":"2024-01-05","tags":"note, tech, fun, shortstory, writing, programming, practices, devops"},"tags":["note","tech","fun","shortstory","writing","programming","practices","devops"]},{"slug":"2023-12-28-linkdump-2","frontmatter":{"title":"Linkdump #2","date":"2023-12-28","tags":"note, tech, programming, linkdump"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","linkdump"]},{"slug":"2023-12-22-10-000-hours","frontmatter":{"title":"10.000 Hours","date":"2023-12-22","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, learnings, books, tech, programming"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","learnings","books","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2023-12-21-notes-on-immutability","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on \"Immutability Changes Everything\"","date":"2023-12-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, note, learnings, review, tech, papers"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","note","learnings","review","tech","papers"]},{"slug":"2023-11-29-real-vs.-fake-trends","frontmatter":{"title":"Real vs. Fake Trends","date":"2023-11-29","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, quote, opinion, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","quote","opinion","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
