It's often thrown around as a buzzword whenever somebody is talking about \"what comes after development\". Obviously, it's not just that. Or is it?

I just had a fruitful conversation with the DevOps lead of a client, and they phrased this role in a very fitting way.\r\n\r\n> A DevOps Engineer doesn't push the button, they enable the developers to push the button themselves.\r\n\r\nTo me this role is fascinating, since it touches so many different aspects of software delivery.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 065 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
