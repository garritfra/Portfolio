Accountants don't use erasers or they go to jail.\r\n\r\nThe paper [Immutability Changes Everything](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper16.pdf) by Pat Helland talks about the trend towards immutability in data storage thoughout all layers of the stack. From append-only apps (Record changes, then derive the current state), down to how bits are stored on a hard drive (e.g. Copy on Write).\n\nI stumbled upon this paper through the [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/) collection. I was specifically looking for a paper that's short and easy to comprehend, since I don't have much experience in reading scientific papers. This is absolutely both short and easy to comprehend. If you're a beginner like me, I can highly recommend this one to you.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways:\r\n\r\n* Immutability enables clean replication\r\n* Change logs (e.g. [write-ahead logs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging)) are the source of truth. The database is a cache of a subset of those change logs\r\n* It's okay to consider violating [normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) rules to trade storage cost for read speed\r\n* Modern SSDs minimize wear by storing new versions of data to other blocks instead of mutating the data in place\r\n* The cost of immutability is increased storage\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 098 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on \"Immutability Changes Everything\"","date":"2023-12-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, note, learnings, review, tech, papers"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","note","learnings","review","tech","papers"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-12-22-10-000-hours","frontmatter":{"title":"10.000 Hours","date":"2023-12-22","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, learnings, books, tech, programming"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","learnings","books","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2023-11-29-real-vs.-fake-trends","frontmatter":{"title":"Real vs. Fake Trends","date":"2023-11-29","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, quote, opinion, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","quote","opinion","tech"]},{"slug":"2023-11-24-positive-hackernews","frontmatter":{"title":"A Positive Hacker News RSS Feed","date":"2023-11-24","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, tech, positivity, hackernews"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","tech","positivity","hackernews"]},{"slug":"2023-11-20-re--writing-code-for-both-computers-and-humans","frontmatter":{"title":"re: Writing code for both computers and humans","date":"2023-11-20","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, opinion, web, javascript, tech, reply"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","opinion","web","javascript","tech","reply"]},{"slug":"2023-11-01-tracking-sqlite-database-changes-in-git","frontmatter":{"title":"Tracking SQLite Database Changes in Git","date":"2023-11-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech, sqlite"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech","sqlite"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
