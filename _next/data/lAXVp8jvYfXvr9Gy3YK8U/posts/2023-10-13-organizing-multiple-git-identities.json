{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-10-13-organizing-multiple-git-identities","markdownBody":"\nHere's a quick tip on how to manage multiple Git identities (e.g. personal, work, client1, client2).\r\n\r\nI organize my Git repos in three levels. My personal projects live in a `~/sources` directory. All my work projects live in `~/work`. This is the first level.\r\n\r\nLevel 2 is the client, e.g. `~/work/client1`. Naturally, level 3 is the project repository: `~/work/client1/foo-api`.\r\n\r\nThis is how my work directory is organized:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/Users/garrit/work\r\n├── client1\r\n│   ├── foo-api\r\n│   ├── foo-ios\r\n│   └── foo-android\r\n└── client2\r\n    ├── bar-ios\r\n    └── bar-middleware\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, say that `client2` demands that we commit with a different identity than our default work email. Besides that, you probably also have a personal email address for your own projects. How do you manage that?\r\n\r\n## .gitconfig includes\r\n\r\nThe global configuration file for Git is `~/.gitconfig`. If you've ever set a parameter like `git config user.name \"Foo Bar\"`: this is where it ended up.\r\n\r\nOne awesome feature of the .gitconfig file is that you can **conditionally include other config files**, and this is what does the trick. Here's my `~/.gitconfig` file:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[user]\r\n    name = Garrit Franke\r\n    email = garrit@slashdev.space\r\n\r\n[includeIf \"gitdir:~/work/\"]\r\n    path = ~/.gitconfig-work\r\n\r\n[includeIf \"gitdir:~/work/client2/\"]\r\n    path = ~/.gitconfig-client2\r\n\r\n[includeIf \"gitdir:~/sources/\"]\r\n    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal\r\n\r\n# ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, my name and email are always set to my personal identity. I also store some other global settings here, but those are not relevant for this post. If the repository is located inside the `~/work` directory, a file named `~/.gitconfig-work` is included. This is just another gitconfig file. This is what that looks like in my case:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[user]\r\n    name = Garrit Franke\r\n    signingkey = 12345678\r\n    email = garrit@work.de\r\n\r\n[commit]\r\n    gpgsign = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope you'll see where this is going. For every identity, you keep a separate gitconfig file and include it in the main `~/.gitconfig`. Crucially, this requires you to organize your repositories grouped by client.\r\n\r\nThis trick has simplified my project onboarding quite a bit. No more \"You forgot to update your Email Address\" requests from clients!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 083 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Organizing multiple Git identities","date":"2023-10-13","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-01-05-greg-the-developer","frontmatter":{"title":"Greg, the Developer","date":"2024-01-05","tags":"note, tech, fun, shortstory, writing, programming, practices"},"tags":["note","tech","fun","shortstory","writing","programming","practices"]},{"slug":"2023-12-28-linkdump-2","frontmatter":{"title":"Linkdump #2","date":"2023-12-28","tags":"note, tech, programming, linkdump"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","linkdump"]},{"slug":"2023-12-22-10-000-hours","frontmatter":{"title":"10.000 Hours","date":"2023-12-22","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, learnings, books, tech, programming"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","learnings","books","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2023-12-21-notes-on-immutability","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on \"Immutability Changes Everything\"","date":"2023-12-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, note, learnings, review, tech, papers"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","note","learnings","review","tech","papers"]},{"slug":"2023-12-19-another-reason-you-can-t-divide-by-zero","frontmatter":{"title":"Another reason why you can't divide by zero","date":"2023-12-19","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, til, math"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","til","math"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
