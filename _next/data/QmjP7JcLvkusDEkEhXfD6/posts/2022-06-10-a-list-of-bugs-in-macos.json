However, it\nhas some really annoying problems that don't seem to get attention by Apple.\nThis is a list of things that personally bother me.

Restart required to fix.~~ (This seems to be fixed)\n- Dash-to-dock sometimes doesn't work for fullscreen-applications.\n- When opening a fullscreen window from the workspace-overview, the dock\n  sometimes stays visible. Has to be manually hovered to hide.\n- When using a chromium-based browser on an external monitor in\n  fullscreen-mode, the menu-bar sometimes doesn't appear when hovered.\n- When switching from the internal to an external monitor, the workspace\n  alignment is not how I left it.\n\nThis is post 034 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"A list of bugs in MacOS","date":"2022-06-14","tags":"note, 100DaysToOffload, MacOS, tech, rant"},"tags":["note","100DaysToOffload","MacOS","tech","rant"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-06-03-i-just-cleaned-up-40-gb-of-brew-caches","frontmatter":{"title":"I just cleaned up 40 GB of Brew caches","date":"2024-06-03","tags":"guide, note, tech"},"tags":["guide","note","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-05-24-going-from-self-hosted-to-managed-software","frontmatter":{"title":"Going from self hosted to managed software","date":"2024-05-24","tags":"infrastructure, note, learnings, opinion, homelab, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","note","learnings","opinion","homelab","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-04-15-beware-of-base64-encoded-strings","frontmatter":{"title":"Beware of base64 encoded strings","date":"2024-04-15","tags":"guide, note, learnings, web, til, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","learnings","web","til","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2024-04-11-a-simple-search-bar","frontmatter":{"title":"A simple search bar","date":"2024-04-11","tags":"guide, note, meta, web, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","meta","web","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2024-04-04-pandoc-convert-links-to-footnotes-the-easy-way","frontmatter":{"title":"Pandoc: Convert links to footnotes (the easy way)","date":"2024-04-04","tags":"guide, note, writing, til, tech, programming, pandoc"},"tags":["guide","note","writing","til","tech","programming","pandoc"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
