{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-11-24-smart-move-google","markdownBody":"\nFor as long as I can remember, `maps.google.com` was the defacto domain for\nGoogle Maps. Also for as long as I can remember, I allowed this domain to use\nthe location services of my browser.\n\nYesterday I was asked to allow the usage of location services for Google Maps\nseemingly out of nowhere. Of course I accepted. After all, I just wanted to\ncheck a route to a local business and I was in a hurry. Back home I opened\nGoogle Maps again, and noticed that `maps.google.com` now redirects to\n`google.com/maps`. This implies that the permissions I give to Google Maps now\napply to **all** of Googles services hosted under this domain. So far I only\nidentified Google Flights to have made the same switch (`google.com/flights`),\nthough I'm sure they're just beginning to transfer their services to the main\n`google.com` domain.\n\nCongratulations, you now have permission to geo-track me across **all** of your\nservices.\n\nSmart move, Google.\n\nThis is post 043 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n---\n\nThis post generated some interesting discussions on\n[HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33729345).\n\n### Backlinks\n\n- [Google Bypasses Privacy, Puts Users’ Data on the Map](https://analyticsindiamag.com/google-bypasses-privacy-puts-users-data-on-the-map/)\n- [Last Week in Local - December 5, 2022](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EfB2yqlh7B62701mzc82v)\n- [Softantenna](https://softantenna.com/blog/google-smart-move/) ([English](https://softantenna-com.translate.goog/blog/google-smart-move/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp))\n- [Google kann euren Standort unter Umständen mit allen Services verfolgen](https://stadt-bremerhaven.de/google-kann-euren-standort-unter-umstaenden-mit-allen-services-verfolgen/) ([English](https://stadt--bremerhaven-de.translate.goog/google-kann-euren-standort-unter-umstaenden-mit-allen-services-verfolgen/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp))\n- [zive.cz](https://www.zive.cz/clanky/google-vymyslel-figl-jak-nas-plosne-sledovat-stacilo-mapam-zmenit-adresu/sc-3-a-219564/default.aspx) ([English](https://www-zive-cz.translate.goog/clanky/google-vymyslel-figl-jak-nas-plosne-sledovat-stacilo-mapam-zmenit-adresu/sc-3-a-219564/default.aspx?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp))\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Smart Move, Google","date":"2022-11-24","tags":"note, 100DaysToOffload, practices"},"tags":["note","100DaysToOffload","practices"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-05-19-work-batch-sizing","frontmatter":{"title":"Optimizing work batch size","date":"2023-05-19","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, learnings, life, devops"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","learnings","life","devops"]},{"slug":"2023-04-22-the-role-of-a-devops-engineer","frontmatter":{"title":"The role of a DevOps Engineer","date":"2023-04-22","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, devops"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","devops"]},{"slug":"2023-03-26-software-is-not-defined-by-the-language-it's-written-in","frontmatter":{"title":"Software is not defined by the language it's written in","date":"2023-03-26","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, opinion"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","opinion"]},{"slug":"2023-03-11-a-software-requirements-checklist","frontmatter":{"title":"A software requirements checklist","date":"2023-03-11","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, quote, practices"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","quote","practices"]},{"slug":"2023-02-14-openssf-best-practices","frontmatter":{"title":"OpenSSF Best Practices","date":"2023-02-14","tags":"note, 100DaysToOffload, practices"},"tags":["note","100DaysToOffload","practices"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
