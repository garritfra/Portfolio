Now, step by step, slowly walk across this rope until you're at the other side.\n\nI often use this experiment as an indication for how focused I am at a given moment. As easy as this sounds, I rarely make it to the other side. On some days, I can't even step on the rope before my mind gets distracted and I have to start over. On some other days, I may get a few steps before falling off. With enough practice however, I may get to the other side.\n\nThis technique also works very well for short meditation sessions. I close my eyes and try to get to the other side. Whenever I fall off, I try again until my mind is focused enough to walk the entire rope.\n\nI'm curious: are you able to walk the entire rope, or are you also struggling to take control over this mindscape?\n\n---\n\nThis is post 079 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"The Mind Rope Experiment","date":"2023-10-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-12-15-i-m-finally-off-coffee","frontmatter":{"title":"I'm finally off coffee","date":"2023-12-15","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life"]},{"slug":"2023-12-01-field-notes-3","frontmatter":{"title":"Field Notes #3","date":"2023-12-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, notebooks"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","notebooks"]},{"slug":"2023-11-07-app-defaults","frontmatter":{"title":"My App Defaults (Late 2023)","date":"2023-11-07","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, fun, life, random"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","fun","life","random"]},{"slug":"2023-10-10-did-you-try-turning-it-off","frontmatter":{"title":"Did you try turning it off?","date":"2023-10-10","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","life"]},{"slug":"2023-10-09-field-notes-2","frontmatter":{"title":"Field Notes #2","date":"2023-10-09","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, notebooks"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","notebooks"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
