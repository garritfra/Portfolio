Also for as long as I can remember, I allowed this domain to use\nthe location services of my browser.\n\nYesterday I was asked to allow the usage of location services for Google Maps\nseemingly out of nowhere. Of course I accepted. After all, I just wanted to\ncheck a route to a local business and I was in a hurry. Back home I opened\nGoogle Maps again, and noticed that `maps.google.com` now redirects to\n`google.com/maps`. This implies that the permissions I give to Google Maps now\napply to **all** of Googles services hosted under this domain. So far I only\nidentified Google Flights to have made the same switch (`google.com/flights`),\nthough I'm sure they're just beginning to transfer their services to the main\n`google.com` domain.\n\nCongratulations, you now have permission to geo-track me across **all** of your\nservices.\n\nSmart move, Google.\n\nThis is post 043 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n---\n\nThis post generated some interesting discussions on\n[HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33729345).\n\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
