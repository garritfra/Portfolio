Now, step by step, slowly walk across this rope until you're at the other side.\n\nI often use this experiment as an indication for how focused I am at a given moment. As easy as this sounds, I rarely make it to the other side. On some days, I can't even step on the rope before my mind gets distracted and I have to start over. On some other days, I may get a few steps before falling off. With enough practice however, I may get to the other side.\n\nThis technique also works very well for short meditation sessions. I close my eyes and try to get to the other side. Whenever I fall off, I try again until my mind is focused enough to walk the entire rope.\n\nI'm curious: are you able to walk the entire rope, or are you also struggling to take control over this mindscape?\n\n---\n\nThis is post 079 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"The Mind Rope Experiment","date":"2023-10-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-09-09-everyday-carry-notebooks","frontmatter":{"title":"About My Pocket Notebook","date":"2023-09-09","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, notebooks"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","notebooks"]},{"slug":"2023-08-23-so,-you-want-to-win-the-lottery","frontmatter":{"title":"So, you want to win the lottery","date":"2023-08-23","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, til, random"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","til","random"]},{"slug":"2023-06-25-make-a-list","frontmatter":{"title":"Make a List","date":"2023-06-25","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life"]},{"slug":"2023-05-19-work-batch-sizing","frontmatter":{"title":"Optimizing work batch size","date":"2023-05-19","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, learnings, life, devops"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","learnings","life","devops"]},{"slug":"2023-04-07-older-is-often-better","frontmatter":{"title":"Older is often better","date":"2023-04-07","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","life"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
