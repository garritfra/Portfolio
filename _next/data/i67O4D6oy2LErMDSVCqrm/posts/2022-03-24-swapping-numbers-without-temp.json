The trick is\nquite old and you might already know about this, but when I started out with\nprogramming, it blew my mind.\n\nIn school, we get taught to use a temporary\nvariable to swap two numbers:\n\n```js\nlet a = 5\nlet b = 10\n\nlet temp = a;\n\na = b    // a = 10\nb = temp // b = 5\n```\n\nBut by using some arithmetic, we can save us a few bytes of memory:\n\n```js\nlet a = 5\nlet b = 10\n\na = a + b // a = 15 ; b = 10\nb = a - b // a = 15 ; b = 5\na = a - b // a = 10 ; b = 5 \n```\n\nPlease **never** use this in any production code. The less we have to think\nabout a piece of code, the better it is. It's a fun thought experiment\nnevertheless!\n\n---\n\nThis is post 026 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
