{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-02-22-dockerignore-troubles","markdownBody":"\r\nI commonly used to create a `.Dockerignore` file next to my `Dockerfile`. After countless hours of ignoring the problems in my setup, I found out that the uppercase `.Dockerignore` doesn't get picked up by Docker on MacOS. Only the lowercase `.dockerignore` is valid.\r\n\r\nI didn't find official documentation on this, but I think it's because both MacOS and Linux are case-sensitive, while Windows isn't. I don't remember why I got used to the `.Dockerignore` convention, but I swear I saw someone using it in the wild. Or it's my (un)logical reasoning that, because `Dockerfile` is uppercased, `.Dockerignore` should be uppercased as well.\r\n\r\nEither way, stay away from `.Dockerfile`s and stick to `.dockerfile`s.\r\n\r\nThis is post 050 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Dockerignore troubles","date":"2023-02-22","tags":"note, docker, web, 100DaysToOffload, tech"},"tags":["note","docker","web","100DaysToOffload","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-01-06-a-better-publishing-workflow-for-static-blogs","frontmatter":{"title":"A better publishing workflow for static blogs","date":"2024-01-06","tags":"guide, note, meta, writing, web, github, tech"},"tags":["guide","note","meta","writing","web","github","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-01-05-greg-the-developer","frontmatter":{"title":"Greg, the Developer","date":"2024-01-05","tags":"note, tech, fun, shortstory, writing, programming, practices, devops"},"tags":["note","tech","fun","shortstory","writing","programming","practices","devops"]},{"slug":"2023-12-28-linkdump-2","frontmatter":{"title":"Linkdump #2","date":"2023-12-28","tags":"note, tech, programming, linkdump"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","linkdump"]},{"slug":"2023-12-22-10-000-hours","frontmatter":{"title":"10.000 Hours","date":"2023-12-22","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, learnings, books, tech, programming"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","learnings","books","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2023-12-21-notes-on-immutability","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on \"Immutability Changes Everything\"","date":"2023-12-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, note, learnings, review, tech, papers"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","note","learnings","review","tech","papers"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
