{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-03-18-fix-traefik-proxy-issues","markdownBody":"\nAfter changing my proxy from NGINX to Traefik, I noticed that some of my\nservices started misbehaving.\n\nIn particular, my instance of\n[BirdsiteLive](https://github.com/NicolasConstant/BirdsiteLive)\n([birdsite.slashdev.space](https://birdsite.slashdev.space)) had issues\nforwarding tweets to the\n[Fediverse](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2021-01-18-reasons-the-fediverse-is-better).\n\nThe only difference between my old NGINX and my Traefik config were the headers.\nI didn't think that that's what's causing the issue, but after digging around a\nbit I figured out what's wrong. I still can't wrap my head around it entirely,\nbut it has something to do with forwarding external `https` requests to internal\n`http` services, since the `x-forwarded-` headers where missing in the forwarded\nrequests.\n\nIn the world of NGINX, we can instruct the proxy to forward _all_ headers using\nthis directive:\n\n```conf\nproxy_pass_request_headers      on;\n```\n\nwhich takes care of the issue. In Traefik, it's a bit more convoluted. Traefik\ncan use a combination of \"Entrypoints\" and middleware to route traffic around.\nIn my setup, I use a `webSecure` entrypoint listening for SSL/TLS traffic, and a\n`web` entrypoint that just redirects to `webSecure`:\n\n```yaml\nentryPoints:\n  web:\n    address: :80\n    http:\n      redirections:\n        entryPoint:\n          to: \"websecure\"\n          scheme: \"https\"\n\n  websecure:\n    address: :443\n```\n\nApparently, some services send requests to the `web` entrypoint, and the\n`x-forwarded-for` headers are dropped. To prevent this, you can set the\n`proxyProtocol` and `forwardedHeaders` in the `web` entrypoint to `insecure`,\nlike so:\n\n```yaml\nentryPoints:\n  web:\n    address: :80\n    proxyProtocol:\n      insecure: true\n    forwardedHeaders:\n      insecure: true\n    # ...\n# ...\n```\n\nI'm sure there's a reason why this is marked as `insecure`, but it behaves just\nlike the NGINX counterpart, so I didn't bother digging deeper into the matter.\nMaybe one day I'll come back to properly fix this.\n\nIf you want to read more, check out\n[this](https://medium.com/@_jonas/traefik-kubernetes-ingress-and-x-forwarded-headers-82194d319b0e)\narticle on Medium. It explains the issue in more detail.\n\n---\n\nThis is post 025 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Fixing Traefik Proxy Issues","date":"2022-03-18","tags":"note, guide, infrastructure, web, 100DaysToOffload, homelab"},"tags":["note","guide","infrastructure","web","100DaysToOffload","homelab"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-12-18-overcoming-air-hunger","frontmatter":{"title":"Overcoming \"air hunger\"","date":"2023-12-18","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, life, til"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","life","til"]},{"slug":"2023-12-12-roast-my-site","frontmatter":{"title":"Roast my Site!","date":"2023-12-12","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, meta, writing, web, random"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","meta","writing","web","random"]},{"slug":"2023-11-20-re--writing-code-for-both-computers-and-humans","frontmatter":{"title":"re: Writing code for both computers and humans","date":"2023-11-20","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, opinion, web, javascript, tech, reply"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","opinion","web","javascript","tech","reply"]},{"slug":"2023-11-01-tracking-sqlite-database-changes-in-git","frontmatter":{"title":"Tracking SQLite Database Changes in Git","date":"2023-11-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech, sqlite"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech","sqlite"]},{"slug":"2023-10-13-organizing-multiple-git-identities","frontmatter":{"title":"Organizing multiple Git identities","date":"2023-10-13","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
