{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-04-07-older-is-often-better","markdownBody":"\nI'm guilty of buying shiny new things. After being unhappy with the Bluetooth connectivity in the OnePlus Nord I bought in december of 2020, I bought a brand new Pixel 7 last december. I told myself that t would be using the OnePlus Nord for at least three years, preferably four, yet I gave in after two years due to some issue that could have been fixed with a pair of cable-headphones. I'm now asking myself again: am I able to use my new Pixel 7 for more than 3 years?\n\nI just stumbled upon a blog post called \"[My long goodbye to Windows XP](https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/my-long-goodbye-to-windows-xp)\", in which the author explains that he is currently replacing his 2008 laptop running Windows XP with a \"new\" PC running Windows 7. He states that he knew the ins and outs of this operating system, so why switch to a new one? Eventually he did switch, but to an OS that is already end of life.\n\nI totally love this. If you're happy with what you got, you shouldn't let a new feature dictate how to change your workflow. Does one really need the features introduced in some software/hardware/tool in the past year? Wouldn't it make sense to use the things that have been battle-tested for at least a few years?\n\nAs I said, I'm very guilty of living at the cutting edge of technology. Maybe it's time to slow down. I'm certain it would simplify a lot of things.\n\n---\n\nThis is post 063 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Older is often better","date":"2023-04-07","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-09-09-everyday-carry-notebooks","frontmatter":{"title":"About My Pocket Notebook","date":"2023-09-09","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, notebooks"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","notebooks"]},{"slug":"2023-08-23-so,-you-want-to-win-the-lottery","frontmatter":{"title":"So, you want to win the lottery","date":"2023-08-23","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, til, random"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","til","random"]},{"slug":"2023-06-25-make-a-list","frontmatter":{"title":"Make a List","date":"2023-06-25","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life"]},{"slug":"2023-05-19-work-batch-sizing","frontmatter":{"title":"Optimizing work batch size","date":"2023-05-19","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, learnings, life, devops"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","learnings","life","devops"]},{"slug":"2023-04-01-quality-vs.-quantity","frontmatter":{"title":"Quality vs. Quantity","date":"2023-04-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, meta, writing, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","meta","writing","life"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
