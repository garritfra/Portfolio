{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2024-04-15-beware-of-base64-encoded-strings","markdownBody":"\r\nI just encountered a fun little bug that I thought is worth sharing.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**: the base64 util breaks lines after a certain number of columns. Use a [flag](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/base64.1.html) to specify \"don't break\". Here's the commit that fixes the issue:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1588\" alt=\"image (3)\" src=\"https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/dba76692-c89f-44da-b70a-f6732a406d75\">\r\n\r\nIt started when we noticed that a cronjob that used wget to regularly call an endpoint failed on one specific environment. The endpoint uses [Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), which is essentially a header with a [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded representation of a username and password. [Curl](https://curl.se/) has this functionality [built in](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-u), but to keep the attack surface as small as possible, we decided to stick to [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), which is part of busybox, to keep the container image size under 1 MB (!). After all, all we want to do is ping an endpoint.\r\n\r\nThis is the command we used up to this point:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwget --post-data=\"\" -O - --header=\"Authorization: Basic $(echo -n $BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME:$BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD | base64)\" http://endpoint:8080/v1/cache\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe noticed that the request worked fine on non-prod environments, but it failed on production with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe HTTP header line [b2verlk1rwjsnutbcapkjh==] does not conform to RFC 7230. The request has been rejected.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter digging around for a while and separating out the individual pieces of the commands, I noticed that the subcommand to build the header value (`echo -n $BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME:$BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD | base64`) behaved differently on prod vs. non-prod. The password on prod is way longer compared to the other environments. Let's run this command with a short input:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/ $ echo -n someuser:somepassword | base64\r\nc29tZXVzZXI6c29tZXBhc3N3b3Jk\r\n/ $\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd again with a long input:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/ $ echo -n someuser:somepasswordthatswaylongerthanthefirstonebutalsoverysecureandsafe | base64\r\nc29tZXVzZXI6c29tZXBhc3N3b3JkdGhhdHN3YXlsb25nZXJ0aGFudGhlZmlyc3RvbmVidXRhbHNv\r\ndmVyeXNlY3VyZWFuZHNhZmU=\r\n/ $\r\n```\r\n\r\nBingo! There's a rogue newline character in the output of `base64`. The fix is very straight-forward. Using the `-w0` [flag for base64](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/base64.1.html), we can force the output to be on the same line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/ $ echo -n someuser:somepasswordthatswaylongerthanthefirstonebutalsoverysecureandsafe | base64 -w0\r\nc29tZXVzZXI6c29tZXBhc3N3b3JkdGhhdHN3YXlsb25nZXJ0aGFudGhlZmlyc3RvbmVidXRhbHNvdmVyeXNlY3VyZWFuZHNhZmU=\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis eventually fixed the issue. Not something I would've ever thought of!\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Beware of base64 encoded strings","date":"2024-04-15","tags":"guide, note, learnings, web, til, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","learnings","web","til","tech","programming"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-04-11-a-simple-search-bar","frontmatter":{"title":"A simple search bar","date":"2024-04-11","tags":"guide, note, meta, web, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","meta","web","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2024-04-10-beating-elden-ring","frontmatter":{"title":"Beating Elden Ring","date":"2024-04-10","tags":"note, learnings, life, review, gaming"},"tags":["note","learnings","life","review","gaming"]},{"slug":"2024-04-04-pandoc-convert-links-to-footnotes-the-easy-way","frontmatter":{"title":"Pandoc: Convert links to footnotes (the easy way)","date":"2024-04-04","tags":"guide, note, writing, til, tech, programming, pandoc"},"tags":["guide","note","writing","til","tech","programming","pandoc"]},{"slug":"2024-04-02-fuck-trees-use-tags","frontmatter":{"title":"Fuck trees, use tags","date":"2024-04-02","tags":"note, opinion, tech"},"tags":["note","opinion","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-01-30-to-prove-something-is-true-try-disproving-it-first","frontmatter":{"title":"To prove something is true, try disproving it first","date":"2024-01-30","tags":"note, quote, practices, til, science"},"tags":["note","quote","practices","til","science"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
