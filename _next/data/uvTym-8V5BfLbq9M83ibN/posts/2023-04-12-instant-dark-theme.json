{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme","markdownBody":"\nThanks to [Jacksons](https://jacksonchen666.com/) [update to darktheme.club](https://github.com/garritfra/darktheme.club/pull/79), I just came across a neat little [CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) that turns a mostly CSS-free document into a pleasantly dark site:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n  color-scheme: light dark;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will adjust all elements on the page to the color scheme preferred by the user - without any other custom styles! ðŸ¤¯ It is also [widely supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_color-scheme) by browsers.\r\n\r\nI've always been quite dependent on CSS-frameworks for any project I'm starting. Going forward, I'd be interested to see how framework-less sites would feel using this property. If all else fails, there's always the awesome [simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) library, which you can slap on top of a raw document to make it pretty (and dark, if preferred) without using custom classes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 064 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Instant dark theme","date":"2023-04-12","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, learnings, web, css, til"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","learnings","web","css","til"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-10-13-organizing-multiple-git-identities","frontmatter":{"title":"Organizing multiple Git identities","date":"2023-10-13","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech"]},{"slug":"2023-08-23-so,-you-want-to-win-the-lottery","frontmatter":{"title":"So, you want to win the lottery","date":"2023-08-23","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, til, random"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","til","random"]},{"slug":"2023-06-01-single-page-applications-on-github-pages","frontmatter":{"title":"Single Page Applications on GitHub Pages","date":"2023-06-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, web, javascript, github"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","web","javascript","github"]},{"slug":"2023-05-19-work-batch-sizing","frontmatter":{"title":"Optimizing work batch size","date":"2023-05-19","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, learnings, life, devops"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","learnings","life","devops"]},{"slug":"2023-04-28-serverless-framework-retrospective","frontmatter":{"title":"Serverless Framework Retrospective","date":"2023-04-28","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, note, terraform, learnings, devops, serverless"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","note","terraform","learnings","devops","serverless"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
