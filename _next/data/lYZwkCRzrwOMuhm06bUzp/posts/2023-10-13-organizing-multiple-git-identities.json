{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-10-13-organizing-multiple-git-identities","markdownBody":"\nHere's a quick tip on how to manage multiple Git identities (e.g. personal, work, client1, client2).\r\n\r\nI organize my Git repos in three levels. My personal projects live in a `~/sources` directory. All my work projects live in `~/work`. This is the first level.\r\n\r\nLevel 2 is the client, e.g. `~/work/client1`. Naturally, level 3 is the project repository: `~/work/client1/foo-api`.\r\n\r\nThis is how my work directory is organized:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/Users/garrit/work\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ client1\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ foo-api\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ foo-ios\r\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ foo-android\r\nâ””â”€â”€ client2\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ bar-ios\r\n    â””â”€â”€ bar-middleware\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, say that `client2` demands that we commit with a different identity than our default work email. Besides that, you probably also have a personal email address for your own projects. How do you manage that?\r\n\r\n## .gitconfig includes\r\n\r\nThe global configuration file for Git is `~/.gitconfig`. If you've ever set a parameter like `git config user.name \"Foo Bar\"`: this is where it ended up.\r\n\r\nOne awesome feature of the .gitconfig file is that you can **conditionally include other config files**, and this is what does the trick. Here's my `~/.gitconfig` file:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[user]\r\n    name = Garrit Franke\r\n    email = garrit@slashdev.space\r\n\r\n[includeIf \"gitdir:~/work/\"]\r\n    path = ~/.gitconfig-work\r\n\r\n[includeIf \"gitdir:~/work/client2/\"]\r\n    path = ~/.gitconfig-client2\r\n\r\n[includeIf \"gitdir:~/sources/\"]\r\n    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal\r\n\r\n# ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, my name and email are always set to my personal identity. I also store some other global settings here, but those are not relevant for this post. If the repository is located inside the `~/work` directory, a file named `~/.gitconfig-work` is included. This is just another gitconfig file. This is what that looks like in my case:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[user]\r\n    name = Garrit Franke\r\n    signingkey = 12345678\r\n    email = garrit@work.de\r\n\r\n[commit]\r\n    gpgsign = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope you'll see where this is going. For every identity, you keep a separate gitconfig file and include it in the main `~/.gitconfig`. Crucially, this requires you to organize your repositories grouped by client.\r\n\r\nThis trick has simplified my project onboarding quite a bit. No more \"You forgot to update your Email Address\" requests from clients!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 083 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Organizing multiple Git identities","date":"2023-10-13","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-11-29-real-vs.-fake-trends","frontmatter":{"title":"Real vs. Fake Trends","date":"2023-11-29","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, quote, opinion, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","quote","opinion","tech"]},{"slug":"2023-11-24-positive-hackernews","frontmatter":{"title":"A Positive Hacker News RSS Feed","date":"2023-11-24","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, tech, positivity, hackernews"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","tech","positivity","hackernews"]},{"slug":"2023-11-20-re--writing-code-for-both-computers-and-humans","frontmatter":{"title":"re: Writing code for both computers and humans","date":"2023-11-20","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, opinion, web, javascript, tech, reply"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","opinion","web","javascript","tech","reply"]},{"slug":"2023-11-01-tracking-sqlite-database-changes-in-git","frontmatter":{"title":"Tracking SQLite Database Changes in Git","date":"2023-11-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech, sqlite"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech","sqlite"]},{"slug":"2023-09-11-linkdump-software-development","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ”— Linkdump: Software Development","date":"2023-09-11","tags":"note, 100DaysToOffload, linkdump, programming, tech"},"tags":["note","100DaysToOffload","linkdump","programming","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
