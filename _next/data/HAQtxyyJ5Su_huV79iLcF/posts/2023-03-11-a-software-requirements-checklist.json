{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-03-11-a-software-requirements-checklist","markdownBody":"\r\nI just found a [great post](https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/a-checklist-manifetsy) on the Etsy Engineering blog suggesting a possible checklist for new product requirements. In reality, this checklist is very hard to fulfill, but it's a nice reminder of what a well thought out requirement could look like.\r\n\r\n### Scope\r\n\r\n- Is the feature meant to be very polished and finished or are we just trying to get user feedback as an MVP?\r\n- If we are running a MVP, is the current feature a true MVP? How can we simplify or cut scope?\r\n\r\n### Eligibility\r\n\r\n- What populations should be included or excluded from the experiment? When should users see this feature? (Which pages, signed in/signed out, mobile, desktop, etc.)\r\nWhere/when should bucketing occur?\r\n- Will the experiment conflict with any other experiments? Do the experiments need to run exclusively?\r\n- What countries should the experiment run in (can impact translations)?\r\n\r\n### A11Y\r\n\r\n- Is there any special accessibility work this feature will require? If extra work is anticipated, check in early with our a11y team.\r\n- When testing and developing we should keep two users in mind - a keyboard user and a voice over user, do we need to add other code for these users?\r\n\r\n### Translations\r\n\r\n- Are there any strings to be translated that should be submitted ASAP?\r\n- Do we need to translate any labels for a11y?\r\n\r\n### Observability\r\n\r\n- How will we know that the feature is working? Are there existing graphs we can use or do we need new ones?\r\n- Should any of these metrics have a threshold or alerting?\r\n- Are we missing any key events to obtain user feedback?\r\n- How will we compare our control and variant?\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n- Is there anything in my experiment that could degrade performance of the site?\r\n- Do I need an operational experiment to verify that Iâ€™m not impacting performance?\r\n\r\n### Error States\r\n\r\n- Do we have designs for loading states?\r\n- Do we have designs for unsuccessful requests and error handling?\r\n- Do we have informative logging when there are errors?\r\n\r\n### QA\r\n\r\n- What set of browsers and devices should we test our new feature against?\r\n- Which user perspectives do we need to test?\r\n\r\n### Ramping\r\n\r\n- What will our ramping strategy be?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out the [original post](https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/a-checklist-manifetsy) for a full writeup and the intentions behind this checklist.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 056 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"A software requirements checklist","date":"2023-03-11","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, quote, practices"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","quote","practices"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-11-29-real-vs.-fake-trends","frontmatter":{"title":"Real vs. Fake Trends","date":"2023-11-29","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, quote, opinion, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","quote","opinion","tech"]},{"slug":"2023-11-20-re--writing-code-for-both-computers-and-humans","frontmatter":{"title":"re: Writing code for both computers and humans","date":"2023-11-20","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, opinion, web, javascript, tech, reply"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","opinion","web","javascript","tech","reply"]},{"slug":"2023-07-12-principles-of-devops--flow","frontmatter":{"title":"Principles of DevOps: Flow","date":"2023-07-12","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, devops, PrinciplesOfDevOps"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","devops","PrinciplesOfDevOps"]},{"slug":"2023-07-11-principles-of-devops-introduction","frontmatter":{"title":"Principles of DevOps: Introduction","date":"2023-07-11","tags":"note, practices, devops, PrinciplesOfDevOps, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["note","practices","devops","PrinciplesOfDevOps","100DaysToOffload"]},{"slug":"2023-05-19-work-batch-sizing","frontmatter":{"title":"Optimizing work batch size","date":"2023-05-19","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, learnings, life, devops"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","learnings","life","devops"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
