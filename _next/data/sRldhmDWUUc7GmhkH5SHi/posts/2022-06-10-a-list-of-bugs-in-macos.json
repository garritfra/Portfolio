However, it\nhas some really annoying problems that don't seem to get attention by Apple.\nThis is a list of things that personally bother me.

Restart required to fix.~~ (This seems to be fixed)\n- Dash-to-dock sometimes doesn't work for fullscreen-applications.\n- When opening a fullscreen window from the workspace-overview, the dock\n  sometimes stays visible. Has to be manually hovered to hide.\n- When using a chromium-based browser on an external monitor in\n  fullscreen-mode, the menu-bar sometimes doesn't appear when hovered.\n- When switching from the internal to an external monitor, the workspace\n  alignment is not how I left it.\n\nThis is post 034 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"A list of bugs in MacOS","date":"2022-06-14","tags":"note, 100DaysToOffload, MacOS, tech, rant"},"tags":["note","100DaysToOffload","MacOS","tech","rant"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-07-02-linkdump-llms","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ”— Linkdump: LLMs","date":"2024-07-02","tags":"note, tech, linkdump, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","linkdump","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-06-17-host-your-own-llm","frontmatter":{"title":"Host your own LLM","date":"2024-06-17","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, homelab, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","homelab","tech","llm","ai"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
