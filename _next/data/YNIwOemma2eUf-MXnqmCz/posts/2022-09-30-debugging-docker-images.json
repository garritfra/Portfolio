Every line in a Dockerfile will generate a\nnew image that builds on top of the last one. This can be really handy if\nsomething is not right in your build.\n\nSince version 18.09 Docker has added a new backend for building images,\n[buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit#buildkit). Unfortunately, buildkit\ndoes not let you view the IDs of the intermediate containers it uses under the\nhood. To work around that, you can opt out of buildkit by running a build with\nbuildkit disabled:\n\n```sh\nDOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build --pull --rm -t myproject:latest .\n```\n\nYou should now see the IDs of the intermediate containers:\n\n```sh\nSending build context to Docker daemon  87.84MB\nStep 1/16 : FROM node:16.15.1-alpine3.16 AS development\n16.15.1-alpine3.16: Pulling from library/node\nDigest: sha256:c785e617c8d7015190c0d41af52cc69be8a16e3d9eb7cb21f0bb58bcfca14d6b\nStatus: Image is up to date for node:16.15.1-alpine3.16\n ---> e548f8c9983f\nStep 2/16 : WORKDIR /usr/src/app\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 34e5c9bdb910\nStep 3/16 : COPY package*.json ./\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 626e4ae998fc\nStep 4/16 : RUN npm install glob rimraf\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 2d036b8354e0\nStep 5/16 : RUN npm install\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 948709b4957f      <-- HERE\nStep 6/16 : COPY . .\n...\n```\n\nAs mentioned, these IDs are valid docker images, so you can just launch them\nand attach a shell like every other image:\n\n```sh\ndocker run -ti --rm 948709b4957f\n```\n\nIf you're not seeing a regular shell, but a Node.js REPL for example, this\nmight be because the `ENTRYPOINT` of that image was set to the binary of that\nREPL. To work around that, you can override the entrypoint:\n\n```sh\ndocker run -ti --rm --entrypoint=/bin/sh 948709b4957f\n```\n\n## When is this helpful?\n\nIf your build fails at a particular step, you can attach a shell to the **last\nworking** step, inspect the filesystem, and execute the failing command manually.\n\nThat's all!\n\nThis is post 039 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Debugging Docker images","date":"2022-09-30","tags":"note, 100DaysToOffload, guide, programming, docker"},"tags":["note","100DaysToOffload","guide","programming","docker"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-09-11-linkdump-software-development","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ”— Linkdump: Software Development","date":"2023-09-11","tags":"note, 100DaysToOffload, linkdump, programming, tech"},"tags":["note","100DaysToOffload","linkdump","programming","tech"]},{"slug":"2023-06-01-single-page-applications-on-github-pages","frontmatter":{"title":"Single Page Applications on GitHub Pages","date":"2023-06-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, web, javascript, github"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","web","javascript","github"]},{"slug":"2023-04-27-migrating-homeassistant-from-sd-to-ssd","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating Homeassistant from SD to SSD","date":"2023-04-27","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, homeassistant, homelab"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","homeassistant","homelab"]},{"slug":"2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme","frontmatter":{"title":"Instant dark theme","date":"2023-04-12","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, learnings, web, css, til"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","learnings","web","css","til"]},{"slug":"2023-03-30-designing-resilient-cloud-infrastructure","frontmatter":{"title":"Designing resilient cloud infrastructure","date":"2023-03-30","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, guide, note, learnings"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","guide","note","learnings"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
