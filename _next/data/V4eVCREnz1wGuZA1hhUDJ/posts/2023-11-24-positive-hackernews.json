{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-11-24-positive-hackernews","markdownBody":"\r\nTech news can often be overwhelmingly negative. Scrolling through [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com), I often feel myself getting angrier at the state of the industry with each headline I read.\r\n\r\nI don't want to give up on the amazing content I'm discovering every day on this platform, so I built an alternative RSS feed for HackerNews. It selectively presents stories that have a positive sentiment, making my news-reading experience more enjoyable and less stressful. Here's a link to the feed:\r\n\r\nhttps://garritfra.github.io/positive_hackernews/feed.xml\r\n\r\nIt's not a pretty link, but who looks at the link of an RSS feed anyway? ;)\r\n\r\n## Comparison\r\n\r\nHere's an example of the HackerNews feed provided by [hnrss.github.io](https://hnrss.github.io/):\r\n\r\n![Before](/assets/posts/2023-11-24-positive-hackernews/before.png)\r\n\r\nAnd here's the filtered, positive-only feed:\r\n\r\n![After](/assets/posts/2023-11-24-positive-hackernews/after.png)\r\n\r\nI don't want to urge anyone to stop reading HackerNews, but if you also struggle with seeing the bright side of tech, this could be a nice alternative.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nThe source code behind this project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/garritfra/positive_hackernews).
