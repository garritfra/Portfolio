{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-05-24-cloning-windows-to-a-new-drive","markdownBody":"\nMy grandpa has been using his current computer for about 10 years now. After\nsuch a long time, the system has become quite slow and bulky. Back then it was\nrelatively normal to use a HDD as a primary hard drive, which adds to the slow\nexperience. It was time for an upgrade!\n\n> **TL;DR**: Use [Clonezilla](https://clonezilla.org/) on a live usb stick to\n> create an exact copy of your old drive onto your new one.\n\nI got him a 512 GB SSD, which, conveniently, is the same size of his current\nHDD. While installing the new drive alongside his existing one, I thought about\nhow to copy the existing Windows-installation.\n\nNa√Øvely, I thought that I could just `dd` the contents of the HDD onto the new\ndrive would work, since, _every byte is copied as is_, or at least that's what I\nthought. Turns out it wasn't that easy. I'm sure it would've worked if I was\nmore careful, but by default, `dd` just wipes over each byte, not caring if it\nmade a mistake. After very long 5 hours, I came back to the PC to see that it\nfinished copying the 512 GB (yes, it's not just copying the data, it's copying\nthe entire partition!). In a super excited mood, I restarted the PC and selected\nthe SSD as a boot medium. Aaaaand... nothing. Windows tried to repair some stuff\nbut it wasn't successful. I fiddled around with the boot partition a bit, but I\nhad to give up after an hour or so.\n\n## The second attempt\n\nAfter researching a bit (I should've done that sooner...) I stumbled across\n[Clonezilla](https://clonezilla.org/), a Linux distribution custom-built for\nthis purpose. I flashed it onto a usb-stick and started the cloning process.\nAfter just 20 minutes (!), it was done cloning the existing data. The process is\nextremely simple!\n\nBefore rebooting, I disconnected the old drive to make sure that there's no\nfunny business going on. Apparently, Windows had to self-adjust UIDs of the\ndrives, but after a short \"Preparing Windows\" animation, the system started up\nas expected. **Success**!!\n\nThe performance of the new hard drive is amazing, at least compared to the HDD\nmy grandpa had before. Plus, we can use the existing HDD to take full system\nbackups every now and then, using the same process.\n\nThis is post 031 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Cloning Windows to a new drive","date":"2022-05-24","tags":"note, guide, windows, til, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["note","guide","windows","til","100DaysToOffload"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-12-11-formula-e-is-essentially-mario-kart","frontmatter":{"title":"Formula E is essentially Mario Kart","date":"2023-12-11","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, til, random"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","til","random"]},{"slug":"2023-11-30-why-you-can't-divide-by-zero","frontmatter":{"title":"Why you can't divide by zero","date":"2023-11-30","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, til, math"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","til","math"]},{"slug":"2023-11-01-tracking-sqlite-database-changes-in-git","frontmatter":{"title":"Tracking SQLite Database Changes in Git","date":"2023-11-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech, sqlite"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech","sqlite"]},{"slug":"2023-10-13-organizing-multiple-git-identities","frontmatter":{"title":"Organizing multiple Git identities","date":"2023-10-13","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech"]},{"slug":"2023-08-23-so,-you-want-to-win-the-lottery","frontmatter":{"title":"So, you want to win the lottery","date":"2023-08-23","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, til, random"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","til","random"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
