I just became a certified diver! ðŸ¥³

I got my license through the [Rumblefish Adventure](https://rumblefishadventure.com/) divecenter in Kata Beach, as per a recommendation from a friend who happened to be around in the area when we were there.

Kata Beach is a great dive spot. It has crazy wildlife, it's just a short swim away from the beach and the visibility is quite good if you haven't seen many reefs yet (like myself).

After doing our PADI Open Water license, we went to Phi Phi Islands to do a fun dive. The experience swimming through the reefs there can simply not be put into words.

In total, we did 7 dives in Thailand. Here's a full list, taken from my logbook:

After Phuket, we went to Vietnam where we're currently also on a lot of fun diving trips. But I'll save that for another dive log post.
