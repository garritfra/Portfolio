We've been taught that, to proof that a thing is true, we should point out what's true about it.

However, we can learn much more about why something is true by trying to **disproof** it first. If you think something is true, try as hard as you can to proof that it's false.

Disproofing a theory is core to the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method). Only when we validate that something cannot be false, we come closer to proofing that it's true.
