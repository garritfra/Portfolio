I loved reading [The Festival](https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/f.aspx) by H.P. Lovecraft, especially this quote by "the mad Arab" at the end of the story. The Festival is one of Lovecrafts first short stories in the [Cthulhu Mythos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos). The quote excellently shows the unique style of Lovecrafts short stories. Each story is a grotesque depiction of horrors that are beyond our imagination. I recently tried to replicate this style of writing in  "[Haunted Memories](/posts/2023-09-10-short-story-haunted-memories)", a short story about digital media. I'm just getting started with reading Lovecrafts stories, but the ones I read so far absolutely blew me away.
