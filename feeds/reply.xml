                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This is a reply to Tony Mottaz&#39; <a href="https://www.tonymottaz.com/code-for-computers-and-humans/">blog post</a> about code that&#39;s easy to understand for humans.</p></blockquote>

<p>The understandability of a piece of code can be measured by how much time one needs to grasp its behavior.</p>

<p>Tony argues that the verbose version of the code (<code>isNaN(defaultValue) ? NaN : defaultValue;</code>) is better than the optimized version (<code>defaultValue;</code>) because it proves that the author has thought of the possible sideeffect.</p>

<p>However, I personally think this is in fact bad code. Although the code is <strong>trying</strong> to make obvious what it&#39;s doing, Tony had to pause and think about why it&#39;s written this way. This probably interrupted their flow of work, which is highly undesired. A short comment should have the same effect while keeping the reader in their flow. This is a perfect example for the &quot;<a href="https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/code-comments-why-not-how/">comment the why, now the how</a>&quot; mantra.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed Tony&#39;s post. It does a great job emphasizing that we should be curious about the code we read and write.</p>
