                <![CDATA[<p>I often find myself using a &quot;real&quot; terminal alongside my VSCode setup, because for some tasks the built-in terminal, due to its small size, is quite flimsy to use. <em>But</em>! I just found out there&#39;s a a way to switch the terminal into fullscreen mode, using the &quot;View: Toggle Maximized Panel&quot; command.</p>

<p>You can bind it to a shortcut, which makes switching between editor and terminal a breeze! Simply add this to your <code>keybindings.json</code> (also accessible via the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette">command palette</a>):</p>

<p><code>
    {
        &quot;key&quot;: &quot;cmd+alt+m&quot;,
        &quot;command&quot;: &quot;workbench.action.toggleMaximizedPanel&quot;
    }
</code></p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I have a YubiKey that I use for work, and I love using it. But I won&#39;t get one for my personal life.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this for some time now, but I ultimately don&#39;t think the benefits outweigh the hassle of always carrying around another device that I risk losing or breaking.</p>

<p>A Yubikey provides a very good second factor, but so does my phone. My phone, just like a Yubikey, is locked behind a third factor (a pin or biometric sensor), so my phone essentially <em>is</em> a Yubikey. You can argue that the authenticator app on my phone (bitwarden) can be hacked, but I&#39;m willing to take that risk if it means I have to reset all security measures on all accounts if I lose the key.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m not getting a Yubikey.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I just finished my first ever infrastructure project for a client. My Terraform skills are good enough to be dangerous, but during the development of this project I learned a lot that I would do differently next time.</p>

<h2>Project structure</h2>

<p>Having worked with semi-professional Terraform code before, I applied what I knew to my new project. That was mainly that we have a shared base and an overlay directory for each environment. I went with a single Terraform module for the shared infrastructure, and variables for each environment. Naively, roughly every service had their own file.</p>

<p><code>
.
├── modules
│   └── infrastructure
│       ├── alb.tf
│       ├── cache.tf
│       ├── database.tf
│       ├── dns.tf
│       ├── ecr.tf
│       ├── ecs.tf
│       ├── iam.tf
│       ├── logs.tf
│       ├── main.tf
│       ├── network.tf
│       ├── secrets.tf
│       ├── security.tf
│       ├── ssl.tf
│       ├── state.tf
│       └── variables.tf
├── production
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── secrets.tf
└── staging
    ├── main.tf
    └── secrets.tf
</code></p>

<p>This works very well, but I already started running into issues extending this setup. For my next project, I would probably find individual components and turn them into smaller reusable submodules. If I were to rewrite the project above, I would probably structure it like this (not a complete project, but I think you get the idea):</p>

<p><code>
.
├── modules
│   └── infrastructure
│       ├── main.tf
│       ├── modules
│       │   ├── database

│       │   │   ├── logs.tf
│       │   │   ├── main.tf
│       │   │   ├── outputs.tf

│       │   │   ├── iam.tf
│       │   │   ├── logs.tf
│       │   │   ├── main.tf
│       │   │   ├── outputs.tf
│       │   │   └── variables.tf
│       │   └── state
│       │       ├── locks.tf
│       │       ├── main.tf
│       │       ├── outputs.tf
│       │       ├── s3.tf
│       │       └── variables.tf
│       ├── main.tf
│       ├── outputs.tf
│       └── variables.tf
├── production
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── secrets.tf
└── staging
    ├── main.tf
    └── secrets.tf
</code></p>

<h2>Secrets</h2>

<p>I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt">git-crypt</a> to manage secrets, but that was only before I learned about <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/sops">SOPS</a>. It&#39;s too late to migrate now, but if I could, I would choose SOPS for secrets any day of the week for upcoming projects. It even has a <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/carlpett/sops/latest/docs">Terraform provider</a>, so there&#39;s no excuse not to use it. ;)</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall I&#39;m pretty happy with how the project turned out, but there are some things that I learned during this project that will pay off later.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I just found a <a href="https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/a-checklist-manifetsy">great post</a> on the Etsy Engineering blog suggesting a possible checklist for new product requirements. In reality, this checklist is very hard to fulfill, but it&#39;s a nice reminder of what a well thought out requirement could look like.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<ul><li>Is the feature meant to be very polished and finished or are we just trying to get user feedback as an MVP?</li><li>If we are running a MVP, is the current feature a true MVP? How can we simplify or cut scope?</li></ul>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<ul><li>What populations should be included or excluded from the experiment? When should users see this feature? (Which pages, signed in/signed out, mobile, desktop, etc.)
Where/when should bucketing occur?</li><li>Will the experiment conflict with any other experiments? Do the experiments need to run exclusively?</li><li>What countries should the experiment run in (can impact translations)?</li></ul>

<h3>A11Y</h3>

<ul><li>Is there any special accessibility work this feature will require? If extra work is anticipated, check in early with our a11y team.</li><li>When testing and developing we should keep two users in mind - a keyboard user and a voice over user, do we need to add other code for these users?</li></ul>

<h3>Translations</h3>

<ul><li>Are there any strings to be translated that should be submitted ASAP?</li><li>Do we need to translate any labels for a11y?</li></ul>

<h3>Observability</h3>

<ul><li>How will we know that the feature is working? Are there existing graphs we can use or do we need new ones?</li><li>Should any of these metrics have a threshold or alerting?</li><li>Are we missing any key events to obtain user feedback?</li><li>How will we compare our control and variant?</li></ul>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<ul><li>Is there anything in my experiment that could degrade performance of the site?</li><li>Do I need an operational experiment to verify that I’m not impacting performance?</li></ul>

<h3>Error States</h3>

<ul><li>Do we have designs for loading states?</li><li>Do we have designs for unsuccessful requests and error handling?</li><li>Do we have informative logging when there are errors?</li></ul>

<h3>QA</h3>

<ul><li>What set of browsers and devices should we test our new feature against?</li><li>Which user perspectives do we need to test?</li></ul>

<h3>Ramping</h3>

<ul><li>What will our ramping strategy be?</li></ul>

                Debugging ECS Tasks

                <![CDATA[<p>I just had to debug an application on AWS ECS. The whole procedure is documented in more detail in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-exec.html">documentation</a>, but I think it&#39;s beneficial (both for my future self and hopefully to someone out there) to write down the proccess in my own words.</p>

<p>First of all, you need access to the cluster via the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/de/cli/">CLI</a>. In addition to the CLI, you need the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html">AWS Session Manager plugin for the CLI</a>. If you&#39;re on MacOS, you can install that via <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/session-manager-plugin">Homebrew</a>:</p>

<p><code>
brew install --cask session-manager-plugin
</code></p>

<p>Next, you need to allow the task you want to debug to be able to execute commands. Since I&#39;m using Terraform, this was just a matter of adding the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/ecs_service#enable_execute_command"><code>enable_execute_command</code></a> attribute to the service:</p>

<p><code>tf
resource &quot;aws_ecs_service&quot; &quot;my_service&quot; {
  name            = &quot;my-service&quot;
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.my_cluster.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.my_task_definition.id
  desired_count   = var.app_count
  launch_type     = &quot;FARGATE&quot;
  enable_execute_command = true # TODO: Disable after debugging
}
</code></p>

<p>You may also need specify an execution role in the task definition:</p>

<p><code>tf
resource &quot;aws_ecs_task_definition&quot; &quot;my_task_definition&quot; {
  family              = &quot;my-task&quot;
  task_role_arn       = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_execution_role.arn
  execution_role_arn  = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_execution_role.arn  # &lt;-- Add this
}
</code></p>

<p>Make sure that this role has the correct access rights. There&#39;s a nice <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/de/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ecs-error-execute-command/">troubleshooting guide</a> going over the required permissions.</p>

<p>If you had to do some modifications, make sure to roll out a new deployment with the fresh settings:</p>

<p><code>
aws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service my-service --force-new-deployment
</code></p>

<p>Now, you should be able to issue commands against any running container!</p>

<p><code>
aws ecs execute-command --cluster westfalen --task &lt;task-id-or-arn&gt; --container my-container --interactive --command=&quot;/bin/sh&quot;
</code></p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>On the surface, Infrastructure as Code tools like <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/de/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a> may seem to behave similar to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> YAMLs, but they are in fact fundamentally different approaches to cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>Terraform tries to provide a declarative way to express imperative actions. If you tell Terraform that you need an EC2 instance, it will notice that no such resource exists and instruct the AWS API to create one. If you don&#39;t need the instance anymore and remove the resource definition from your code, Terraform will also pick that up and instruct the AWS API to delete the instance. This works well in most cases, but every once in a while the declarative state may get out of sync with the real world, resulting in errors that are hard to debug and resolve.</p>

<p>Kubernetes on the other hand is a fully declarative system. In a <a href="/posts/2022-09-22-kubernetes-is-a-domain-specific-database">previous post</a> I touched on how Kubernetes constantly compares the <em>desired</em> state with the <em>actual</em> state of the resources and tries to match the two. Although it is theoretically possible to issue imperative actions, Kubernetes is built from the ground up to be declarative.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>In Kubernetes, pods and containers are often confused. I found a <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-vs-pods/">great article</a> going over the differences of the two terms.</p>

<blockquote><p>Containers and Pods are alike. Under the hood, they heavily rely on Linux namespaces and cgroups. However, Pods aren&#39;t just groups of containers. A Pod is a self-sufficient higher-level construct. All pod&#39;s containers run on the same machine (cluster node), their lifecycle is synchronized, and mutual isolation is weakened to simplify the inter-container communication. This makes Pods much closer to traditional VMs, <a href="https://www.mirantis.com/blog/multi-container-pods-and-container-communication-in-kubernetes/">bringing back the familiar deployment patterns like sidecar or reverse proxy</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>In my own words: Containers are made up of Linux namespaces and cgroups. Pods can be thought of as a cgroup of cgroups (though not really), mimicing the behavior of a virtual machine that runs multiple containers with a synchronized lifecycle. The containers in a pod are losely isolated, making it easy to communicate between each other. Containers in a pod can however set individual resource requests, enabled by Linux namespaces.</p>

<p>I&#39;d highly encourage you to check out <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-vs-pods/">the original article</a> if you want to learn more about this topic.</p>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<p>I was recently tasked with building a rudimentary infrastructure for a PHP application. Coming from a Node.js-driven world where every human and their grandmother has a blog post about containerizing your application, it was very interesting to see where PHP differs to other applications.</p>

<p>One major gotcha for me was that PHP code is executed on <strong>request-time</strong>, meaning a new process is spawned for each incoming request. Most other languages have dedicated runtimes that handle incoming requests. This unique approach is very flexible and scalable, but it comes with the implication that there is a <strong>separate webserver</strong> that calls into the PHP interpreter when it needs to.</p>

<p>In Node.js (and most other languages), you can &quot;just run the app&quot;, as demonstrated by this Dockerfile:</p>

<p><code></code>`dockerfile
FROM node:18.14.2-alpine3.17 AS build</p>

<p>WORKDIR /usr/src/app</p>

<p>COPY package*.json ./</p>

<p>RUN npm ci</p>

<p>COPY . .</p>

<p>EXPOSE 3000</p>

<p>CMD [ &quot;node&quot;, &quot;server.js&quot; ]
<code></code>`</p>

<p>PHP on the other side is rarely used on its own. Most of the time, it needs a webserver alongside it:</p>

<p><code></code>`dockerfile
FROM php:8.1-apache-bullseye</p>

<h1>&lt;snip&gt;</h1>

<p>COPY . /var/www/html
WORKDIR /var/www/html</p>

<h1>&lt;snip&gt;</h1>

<p><code></code>`</p>

<p>As you can see, I&#39;m using the official PHP docker image. The PHP maintainers know that adding a webserver alongside PHP is a very common pattern, so most of the variants of the image ship with a webserver. In this example I&#39;m using Apache, but we might as well use NGINX or some other webserver. There&#39;s also the option to use <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/de/install.fpm.php">FPM</a> as a FastCGI implementation and a webserver in a <strong>separate</strong> container.</p>

<p>Grasping this took me some time, but after it clicked it made many things a lot clearer.</p>

<h2>More complete Dockerfile example</h2>

<p>The Dockerfile above is meant to demonstrate how PHP applications differ from other languages. The following is a more complete example you can use to containerize your PHP application. In this case it’s a Laravel app, so your mileage may vary.</p>

<p><code></code>`dockerfile
FROM php:8.1-apache-bullseye</p>

<p>RUN apt-get clean &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get install --fix-missing -y \

                <![CDATA[<p>Everywhere we look, we&#39;re bombarded with flashy symbols trying to grab our attention. This is even the case where we <strong>think</strong> that we&#39;re in control of what we&#39;re looking at. I made two simple changes that reduce visual distractions in my life.</p>

<h2>Android App Icons</h2>

<p>App icons play a serious role in how we interact with our phone. Over the years, there has been a constant battle for the most flashy icon on our home screen. But there&#39;s a cure: newer versions of Android <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/change-color-of-apps-on-android-phones-5213663">let you choose a color theme for apps that implement it</a>. It&#39;s by far not supported by every app out there, but in my case 90% of the app icons now have the same color. I feel way more comfortable looking at my phone, knowing that less things are trying to grab my attention right when I unlock my phone.</p>

<p>With this change, I found that I am more mindful about what app icon I tap on, since I was used to each icon having a different color. This makes it harder for my muscle memory to develop bad habits.</p>

<h2>RSS-Reader Favicons</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re using an RSS reader, chances are you&#39;re used to seeing a favicon next to the articles. I had the feeling that I was drawn more towards the favicon than the headline of the article, so I started looking for ways to disable favicons all together.</p>

<p>Miniflux provides a way to override the stylesheet of the feed in the settings. Simply append the following code-snippet and the favicons will be history:</p>

<p><code>css
.item-title img, .entry-website img {
  display: none;
}
</code></p>

<p>Of course every reader is different, so you might want to look into the documentation of your reader of choice.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>These changes might seem insignificant, but I found that they made a huge difference in how I interact with my phone. The suggestions above might not apply to your life, but I&#39;d like to encourage you to keep an eye out for unnecessary visual distraction in your life. Try to avoid it as much as possible.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I commonly used to create a <code>.Dockerignore</code> file next to my <code>Dockerfile</code>. After countless hours of ignoring the problems in my setup, I found out that the uppercase <code>.Dockerignore</code> doesn&#39;t get picked up by Docker on MacOS. Only the lowercase <code>.dockerignore</code> is valid.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t find official documentation on this, but I think it&#39;s because both MacOS and Linux are case-sensitive, while Windows isn&#39;t. I don&#39;t remember why I got used to the <code>.Dockerignore</code> convention, but I swear I saw someone using it in the wild. Or it&#39;s my (un)logical reasoning that, because <code>Dockerfile</code> is uppercased, <code>.Dockerignore</code> should be uppercased as well.</p>

<p>Either way, stay away from <code>.Dockerfile</code>s and stick to <code>.dockerfile</code>s.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Modern infrastructure is incredibly complex. I identified 4 main &quot;levels&quot; of infrastructure abstraction:</p>

<h2>Level 1: A website on a server</h2>

<p>This is the most straight forward way to host a website. A webserver hosted on bare metal or a VM.</p>

<h2>Level 2: Multiple servers behind a load balancer</h2>

<p>At this stage, you start treating servers as cattle rather than pets. Servers may be spun up and down at will without influencing the availability of the application.</p>

<h2>Level 3: An orchestrated cluster of servers</h2>

<p>Instead of a server serving a specific purpose (e.g. webserver, DB server, etc.), a server becomes a worker for arbitrary workloads (see Kubernetes, ECS).</p>

<h2>Level 4: Multicluster service mesh</h2>

<p>If an organization manages multiple clusters (e.g. multiple application teams), they can be tied together into a <a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/glossary/#service-mesh">service mesh</a> to better optimize communication and observability.</p>

<h2>Level 5: ???</h2>

<p>History shows that we never stop abstracting. Multicluster service meshes are about the most abstract concept many people (including myself) can comprehend, but I doubt that this is the end of this journey. So, what&#39;s next for modern infrastructure?</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>This is a common question that many people (including me) ask themselves.</p>

<p>I recently came across a great <a href="https://blog.adamchalmers.com/kubernetes-problems/">post</a> which explains the problem really well:</p>

<blockquote><p>Kubernetes exists to solve one problem: how do I run m containers across n servers?</p></blockquote>

<p>The post also nails the answer to <strong>how</strong> Kubernetes solves this problem:</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#39;s a big abstract virtual computer, with its own virtual IP stack, networks, disk, RAM and CPU. It lets you deploy containers as if you were deploying them on one machine that didn&#39;t run anything else. Clusters abstract over the various physical machines that run the cluster.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d highly encourage you to read through the article if you want to learn more about why Kubernetes exists.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Just a quick tip that I thought is worth sharing. Instead of declaring:</p>

<p><code>css
.foo { 
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
}
</code></p>

<p>you can just use:</p>

                OpenSSF Best Practices
            </title>
            <link>

            </pubDate>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<p>The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) provides <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria/0">a list of best
practices</a> for open
source projects. Although this list is tailored towards free and open source
projects, I believe that this list is valuable for <em>all</em> software projects.
Here&#39;s a breakdown of all practices that I consider generic to all projects, no
matter its license, alongside some personal notes.</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<h3>Basic project website content</h3>

<p>The project website MUST succinctly describe what the software does (what problem does it solve?).</p>

<blockquote><p>A website might not always apply, but a README is a good place to put this information.</p></blockquote>

<p>The information on how to contribute MUST explain the contribution process (e.g., are pull requests used?)</p>

<blockquote><p>This information is also best placed in the README.</p></blockquote>

<p>The information on how to contribute SHOULD include the requirements for acceptable contributions (e.g., a reference to any required coding standard)</p>

<blockquote><p>-&gt; README.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>The project MUST provide basic documentation for the software produced by the
project.</p>

<p>The project MUST provide reference documentation that describes the external
interface (both input and output) of the software produced by the project.</p>

<blockquote><p>I wouldn&#39;t consider reference documentation a requirement, but it&#39;s nice to
have.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Other</h3>

<p>The project sites (website, repository, and download URLs) MUST support HTTPS using TLS.</p>

<h2>Change Control</h2>

<h3>Public version-controlled source repository</h3>

<p>The project MUST have a version-controlled source repository ~~that is publicly readable and has a URL~~.</p>

<p>The project&#39;s source repository MUST track what changes were made, who made
the changes, and when the changes were made.</p>

<p>To enable collaborative review, the project&#39;s source repository MUST include interim versions for review between releases; it MUST NOT include only final releases.</p>

<blockquote><p>In some cases, code can&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t be versioned. For most website projects,
review environments in merge requests (Vercel, Netlify, GitLab) could be
considered.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is SUGGESTED that common distributed version control software be used (e.g., git) for the project&#39;s source repository.</p>

<h3>Unique version numbering</h3>

<p>The project results MUST have a unique version identifier for each release
intended to be used by users.</p>

<blockquote><p>Commit hashes can be used as unique version numbers in some cases.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is SUGGESTED that the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) or Calendar Versioning
(CalVer) version numbering format be used for releases. It is SUGGESTED that
those who use CalVer include a micro level value.</p>

<blockquote><p>As mentioned above, projects that are constantly in motion (e.g.
<a href="https://darktheme.club/">darktheme.club</a>) might want to consider using commit
hashes for version numbers instead.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is SUGGESTED that projects identify each release within their version
control system. For example, it is SUGGESTED that those using git identify each
release using git tags.</p>

<blockquote><p>Git tags are often neglected during development, but can be very useful.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Release notes</h3>

<p>The project MUST provide, in each release, release notes that are a
human-readable summary of major changes in that release to help users determine
if they should upgrade and what the upgrade impact will be. The release notes
MUST NOT be the raw output of a version control log (e.g., the &quot;git log&quot; command
results are not release notes). Projects whose results are not intended for
reuse in multiple locations (such as the software for a single website or
service) AND employ continuous delivery MAY select &quot;N/A&quot;.</p>

<blockquote><p>I wrote <a href="/posts/2021-02-20-changelogs">a post</a> about changelogs a while back.</p></blockquote>

<p>The release notes MUST identify every publicly known run-time vulnerability
fixed in this release that already had a CVE assignment or similar when the
release was created. This criterion may be marked as not applicable (N/A) if
users typically cannot practically update the software themselves (e.g., as
is often true for kernel updates). This criterion applies only to the
project results, not to its dependencies. If there are no release notes or
there have been no publicly known vulnerabilities, choose N/A.</p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>

<h3>Vulnerability report process</h3>

<p>If private vulnerability reports are supported, the project MUST include how
to send the information in a way that is kept private.</p>

<blockquote><p>For proprietary projects, it&#39;s often a good idea to have a public &quot;Report an issue&quot;
feature.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Quality</h2>

<h3>Working build system</h3>

<p>If the software produced by the project requires building for use, the
project MUST provide a working build system that can automatically rebuild
the software from source code.</p>

<p>It is SUGGESTED that common tools be used for building the software.</p>

<h3>Automated test suite</h3>

<p>The project MUST use at least one automated test suite ~~that is publicly
released as FLOSS (this test suite may be maintained as a separate FLOSS
project)~~. The project MUST clearly show or document how to run the test
suite(s) (e.g., via a continuous integration (CI) script or via documentation in
files such as BUILD.md, README.md, or CONTRIBUTING.md).</p>

<p>A test suite SHOULD be invocable in a standard way for that language.</p>

<p>E.g. <code>npm run test</code>, <code>cargo test</code>, etc.</p>

<p>It is SUGGESTED that the test suite cover most (or ideally all) the code
branches, input fields, and functionality.</p>

<blockquote><p>Write tests if they are useful, not for the sake of having 100% test coverage.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is SUGGESTED that the project implement continuous integration (where new
or changed code is frequently integrated into a central code repository and
automated tests are run on the result).</p>

<h3>New functionality testing</h3>

<p>The project MUST have a general policy (formal or not) that as major new
functionality is added to the software produced by the project, tests of that
functionality should be added to an automated test suite.</p>

<p>The project MUST have evidence that the test policy for adding tests has been
adhered to in the most recent major changes to the software produced by the
project.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is often covered if you have a CI pipeline.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is SUGGESTED that this policy on adding tests (see test_policy) be
documented in the instructions for change proposals.</p>

<blockquote><p>Consider adding a checkbox to your merge request template. For reference, here&#39;s
a checklist that I often use in templates:</p><p><code></code>`</p><h1>Checklist:</h1><ul><li>[ ] documented in the changelog</li><li>[ ] sufficiently tested</li><li>[ ] sufficiently documented
<code></code>`</li></ul></blockquote>

<h3>Warning flags</h3>

<p>The project MUST enable one or more compiler warning flags, a &quot;safe&quot;
language mode, or use a separate &quot;linter&quot; tool to look for code quality
errors or common simple mistakes, if there is at least one FLOSS tool that
can implement this criterion in the selected language.</p>

<p>The project MUST address warnings.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ensure this by disallowing warnings in your CI pipeline.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is SUGGESTED that projects be maximally strict with warnings in the
software produced by the project, where practical.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<h3>Secure development knowledge</h3>

<p>The project MUST have at least one primary developer who knows how to design
secure software.</p>

<p>At least one of the project&#39;s primary developers MUST know of common kinds of
errors that lead to vulnerabilities in this kind of software, as well as at
least one method to counter or mitigate each of them.</p>

<blockquote><p>Easier said than done, but be vocal if you&#39;re hesitant towards a feature or
implementation path.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Use basic good cryptographic practices</h3>

<p>The software produced by the project MUST use, by default, only cryptographic
protocols and algorithms that are publicly published and reviewed by experts (if
cryptographic protocols and algorithms are used).</p>

<p>If the software produced by the project is an application or library, and its
primary purpose is not to implement cryptography, then it SHOULD only call on
software specifically designed to implement cryptographic functions; it SHOULD
NOT re-implement its own.</p>

<blockquote><p>Don&#39;t reinvent the wheel. Not just for cryptography.</p></blockquote>

<p>The security mechanisms within the software produced by the project MUST use
default keylengths that at least meet the NIST minimum requirements through the
year 2030 (as stated in 2012). It MUST be possible to configure the software so
that smaller keylengths are completely disabled.</p>

<p>The default security mechanisms within the software produced by the project
MUST NOT depend on broken cryptographic algorithms (e.g., MD4, MD5, single DES,
RC4, Dual<em>EC</em>DRBG), or use cipher modes that are inappropriate to the context,
unless they are necessary to implement an interoperable protocol (where the
protocol implemented is the most recent version of that standard broadly
supported by the network ecosystem, that ecosystem requires the use of such an
algorithm or mode, and that ecosystem does not offer any more secure
alternative). The documentation MUST describe any relevant security risks and
any known mitigations if these broken algorithms or modes are necessary for an
interoperable protocol.</p>

<p>The default security mechanisms within the software produced by the project
SHOULD NOT depend on cryptographic algorithms or modes with known serious
weaknesses (e.g., the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm or the CBC mode in
SSH).</p>

<p>The security mechanisms within the software produced by the project SHOULD
implement perfect forward secrecy for key agreement protocols so a session key
derived from a set of long-term keys cannot be compromised if one of the
long-term keys is compromised in the future.</p>

<p>If the software produced by the project causes the storing of passwords for
authentication of external users, the passwords MUST be stored as iterated
hashes with a per-user salt by using a key stretching (iterated) algorithm
(e.g., Argon2id, Bcrypt, Scrypt, or PBKDF2). See also OWASP Password Storage
Cheat Sheet).</p>

<p>The security mechanisms within the software produced by the project MUST
generate all cryptographic keys and nonces using a cryptographically secure
random number generator, and MUST NOT do so using generators that are
cryptographically insecure.</p>

<h3>Secured delivery against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks</h3>

<p>The project MUST use a delivery mechanism that counters MITM attacks. Using
https or ssh+scp is acceptable.</p>

<p>A cryptographic hash (e.g., a sha1sum) MUST NOT be retrieved over http and
used without checking for a cryptographic signature.</p>

<h3>Publicly known vulnerabilities fixed</h3>

<p>There MUST be no unpatched vulnerabilities of medium or higher severity that
have been publicly known for more than 60 days.</p>

<blockquote><p>This can be ensured using
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot">Dependabot</a>
or <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/">Renovate</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Projects SHOULD fix all critical vulnerabilities rapidly after they are reported.</p>

<blockquote><p>Again, use automatic dependency updating mechanisms for this.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Other security issues</h3>

<p>The public repositories MUST NOT leak a valid private credential (e.g., a
working password or private key) that is intended to limit public access.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<h3>Static code analysis</h3>

<p>At least one static code analysis tool (beyond compiler warnings and &quot;safe&quot;
language modes) MUST be applied to any proposed major production release of the
software before its release, if there is at least one ~~FLOSS~~ tool that implements
this criterion in the selected language.</p>

<p>It is SUGGESTED that at least one of the static analysis tools used for the
static_analysis criterion include rules or approaches to look for common
vulnerabilities in the analyzed language or environment.</p>

<p>All medium and higher severity exploitable vulnerabilities discovered with
static code analysis MUST be fixed in a timely way after they are confirmed.</p>

<p>It is SUGGESTED that static source code analysis occur on every commit or at
least daily.</p>

<h3>Dynamic code analysis</h3>

<p>It is SUGGESTED that at least one dynamic analysis tool be applied to any
proposed major production release of the software before its release.</p>

<p>It is SUGGESTED that if the software produced by the project includes
software written using a memory-unsafe language (e.g., C or C++), then at
least one dynamic tool (e.g., a fuzzer or web application scanner) be
routinely used in combination with a mechanism to detect memory safety
problems such as buffer overwrites.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is often overlooked.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is SUGGESTED that the project use a configuration for at least some dynamic
analysis (such as testing or fuzzing) which enables many assertions. In many
cases these assertions should not be enabled in production builds.</p>

<p>All medium and higher severity exploitable vulnerabilities discovered with
dynamic code analysis MUST be fixed in a timely way after they are confirmed.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>2022 has been an eventful year for me. We moved to a new apartment, went to a
couple of weddings (a good indication that we&#39;re getting older!) and finally
started traveling more often.</p>

<p>This year, I launched two projects: <a href="https://darktheme.club">darktheme.club</a> and
<a href="https://seeking-maintainers.net">seeking-maintainers.net</a>. My goal for 2023 is
to make two other projects ready for production:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/garritfra/fling">Fling</a> is a household management app that
I&#39;ve been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a>
with my girlfriend for over a year. I just recently implemented an account
system. You can in fact already download the app on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.garritfra.fling">play
store</a> and
test it out, though in it&#39;s current state it&#39;s just a boring app for to-do and
shopping lists.</p>

<p>Another project I&#39;m planning to launch is
<a href="https://docs.kubinity.com/">Kubinity</a>. The idea behind this project is to give
users access to Kubernetes by allocating a namespace in a shared cluster. This
allows for ultra cheap kubernetes hosting without the burden of maintaining and
scaling a cluster. It also comes with free HA!</p>

<h2>Predictions for 2023</h2>

<ul><li>Meta will change course (again), and kill the &quot;Metaverse&quot;</li><li>Cheap matter devices will enter the market. As a reference point: I predict
that there will be a matter-ready smart plug for under 20€ on Amazon.</li><li>AI generated content will be regulated in some way</li><li>Twitter is still around, but it&#39;s still not profitable</li><li>I still won&#39;t have finished my
<a href="[/posts/2021-01-11-100daystooffload](https://100daystooffload.com/)">#100DaysToOffload</a>
<a href="/posts/2021-01-11-100daystooffload">challenge from 2021</a></li></ul>

<p>Overall, I&#39;m feeling very optimistic about the upcoming year. Let&#39;s see if this
is still true at the end of this year, but let&#39;s not loose hope too early.</p>

<p>Happy new year!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I wrote the initial draft for this post a few months ago, traveling through
Norway in a rented campervan. While roaming the beautiful landscapes, I spent a
lot of time thinking. Reading books while traveling really is the best way to
find new inspiration.</p>

<p>On our trip, we wanted to try out an alternative to Google Maps. Most of the
OpenStreetMap-based apps lack important features, but we recently stumbled upon
<a href="https://www.magicearth.com/">MagicEarth</a>, which perfectly fills the void.
OpenStreetMap has been 95% accurate for us. Those last 5% are mostly less famous
hiking trails and attractions that could easily be filled in by people like you
and me. This inspired me to write this blog post, where I share six ways that
you can contribute to open source knowledge right now.</p>

<h2>OpenStreetMap</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, I spotted some minor inconsistencies in
<a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> while driving through Norway. We
tracked our hikes with an app that is able to export a GPX file, which can be
imported to OpenStreetMap to check if the trail matches (or if it is missing),
and took note of incorrect or sloppy roads/buildings. Back home, I plan to sit
down and fix up those issues.</p>

<p>But you don&#39;t have to be on a roadtrip to contribute to OpenStreetMap! Chances
are you know your local surroundings pretty well. Just navigate to your
neighborhood and see what could be improved. Maybe you know a public toilet, a
park or a secret road that is not shown on the map? As a matter of fact, my
private address was missing, so I added it via the editor. I can now use any of
the many OpenStreetMap-based apps to navigate home!</p>

<h2>Wikipedia (and other wikis)</h2>

<p>I often feel like I can&#39;t contribute much to the vast knowledge of Wikipedia.
<em>Other people are way smarter than me</em> and whatnot. But while you might not be
able to publish worthy edits to a well-known topic, you might know some things
that others haven&#39;t thought of. Is there an entry about your local town? Is
there an interesting member of your (past) family that others might want to read
about?</p>

<p>Of course, there are other wikis beside Wikipedia. Are you using a little-known
tool that has open source documentation in the form of a wiki? How can it be
improved?</p>

<h2>Observation</h2>

<p>You might have never heard of <a href="https://observation.org">observation.org</a>. It&#39;s
an open biodiversity- and nature-database. I just recently learned about them in
our local museum. They had a special exhibition about insects, and called out
for contributions to map out our local flora and fauna.</p>

<p>The idea is simple: snap a picture of an interesting looking insect or plant,
upload it using the website (or one of their apps) and create an &quot;observation&quot;.
Using this information, researchers will be able to understand the biodiversity
of your area. The information is free to use, and anyone can contribute!</p>

<h2>Wardriving</h2>

<p>Wardriving is a fun and useful way to contribute to open source knowledge. By
driving around with a device that can detect and record wireless networks, you
can help to map out the wireless coverage in your area. This information can be
used by researchers, network operators, and other interested parties to
understand the availability and quality of wireless networks.</p>

<p>One popular tool for wardriving is <a href="https://wigle.net/">WiGLE</a>. WiGLE allows you
to easily collect and share information about wireless networks, and contribute
to the global wireless map. To get started with WiGLE, you will need a device
that can detect and record wireless networks. This can be a smartphone, laptop,
or dedicated wardriving device. You will also need to download and install the
WiGLE app, and some basic knowledge of how to use it.</p>

<p>Once you have set up WiGLE, you can start driving around and mapping out the
wireless networks in your area. As you collect data, it will be automatically
uploaded to the WiGLE database, where it can be used by researchers and other
interested parties. Wardriving with WiGLE is a fun and easy way to help advance
scientific research and understanding.</p>

<h2>folding@home</h2>

<p>Another way to contribute to open source knowledge is to participate in the
<a href="https://foldingathome.org/">folding@home</a> project. folding@home is a
distributed computing project that uses the idle processing power of volunteers&#39;
computers to perform scientific calculations and simulations. These calculations
are used to study a wide range of topics, including protein folding, drug
design, and the origins of the universe.</p>

<p>By joining the folding@home network, you can help to advance scientific research
and discovery. The project is open to anyone, and you can participate using your
personal computer, laptop, or even your smartphone. All you need to do is
download and install the folding@home software, and then select the types of
calculations that you want to contribute to.</p>

<p>The folding@home project is a great way to put your idle computing power to good
use, and to contribute to the global effort to advance scientific knowledge. To
learn more, visit the <a href="https://foldingathome.org/">folding@home website</a>.</p>

<h2>Blog posts</h2>

<p>Writing a blog post is a fun and engaging way to contribute to open source
knowledge. You don&#39;t need to be a professional writer or have a formal writing
style. Just jot down some notes about a topic that you are passionate about, and
share your experiences and expertise with others.</p>

<p>Not only will you be helping others to learn from your experiences, but writing
a blog post can also be beneficial for yourself. Capturing your thoughts and
ideas in writing can help you to better understand and organize your own
knowledge. It can also be a great way to reflect on your experiences and to
learn from your successes and failures.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in blogging, you might want to check out the
<a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100DaysToOffload</a> project!</p>

<h1>Wrapping up</h1>

<p>As you can see, there are many ways that you can contribute to open source
knowledge, even if you don&#39;t have a lot of time or expertise. By participating
in projects like OpenStreetMap, Wikipedia, observation.org, and folding@home, or
by sharing your experiences and expertise through blog posts, you can make a
real difference in the community.</p>

<p>Why not give it a try? You might be surprised by how much you can learn and how
much you can help others. And who knows, you might even have some fun along the
way! Thanks for reading, and happy contributing!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>For as long as I can remember, <code>maps.google.com</code> was the defacto domain for
Google Maps. Also for as long as I can remember, I allowed this domain to use
the location services of my browser.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was asked to allow the usage of location services for Google Maps
seemingly out of nowhere. Of course I accepted. After all, I just wanted to
check a route to a local business and I was in a hurry. Back home I opened
Google Maps again, and noticed that <code>maps.google.com</code> now redirects to
<code>google.com/maps</code>. This implies that the permissions I give to Google Maps now
apply to <strong>all</strong> of Googles services hosted under this domain. So far I only
identified Google Flights to have made the same switch (<code>google.com/flights</code>),
though I&#39;m sure they&#39;re just beginning to transfer their services to the main
<code>google.com</code> domain.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you now have permission to geo-track me across <strong>all</strong> of your
services.</p>

                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>Warning</strong>: This is a rather ranty post. I just needed a place to dump my emotions about this topic. Please take it with a grain of salt. :)</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m currently <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/ua-parser-js/pull/8">fiddling
around</a> with User-Agents of
Smart TVs, or more specifically <a href="https://www.hbbtv.org/">HbbTV</a>. Interpreting
them is an absolute nightmare, so let me rant about interesting edge-cases I
discovered along the way.</p>

<p>To set the mood: User-Agents in this field have a standardized format, yet many
vendors seem to do their own thing, making it impossible to build one parser to
rule them all. For reference, here&#39;s what the HbbTV section in a user agent
SHOULD look like:</p>

<p><code>
HbbTV/&lt;version&gt; (&lt;capabilities&gt;; &lt;vendorName&gt;; &lt;modelName&gt;; &lt;softwareVersion&gt;; [&lt;hardwareVersion&gt;]; &lt;familyName&gt;; &lt;reserved&gt;)
</code></p>

<h2>The &quot;we&#39;ll update that later&quot;</h2>

<p><code>
HbbTV/1.1.1 (; Loewe; MB180; 1.0; 1.0;) NetFront/4.1
</code></p>

<p>1.0 for both software and hardware versions suspiciously looks like a working
title. At least we get some information about the vendor and the model.</p>

<h2>The Overcommitted</h2>

<p><code>
Mozilla/5.0 (Linux armv7l) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.143 Safari/537.36 OPR/40.0.2207.0 OMI/4.9.0.237.DOM3-OPT.245 Model/Vestel-MB211 VSTVB MB200 HbbTV/1.2.1 (; JVC; MB211; 3.19.4.2; _TV_NT72563_2017 SmartTvA/3.0.0
</code></p>

<p>It&#39;s nice that we get a lot of information about the device, yet no one seemed
to check if the string actually fits into storage.</p>

<h2>The Lazy Boy</h2>

<p><code>
HbbTV/1.1.1 (;;;;;) Maple;2011
</code></p>

<p>To be fair, this is one of the earliest HbbTV devices ever. No one knew that
this technology would stand the test of time. Apparently not even Samsung.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I learned that building a generic parser for user agents isn&#39;t easy, especially
if the devices you work with could be over a decade old.</p>

<p>One thing that all devices do seem to get right though is the presence of the
HbbTV section in the User-Agent. I did not encounter a single device without it.</p>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<p>I&#39;m currently working on a side project involving reselling Kubernetes clusters.
What I discovered is that it&#39;s impossible to resell <em>managed</em> Kubernetes, as in
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/de/eks/">EKS</a> and
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/">GKE</a>.</p>

<p>The only possible scenario where reselling Kubernetes to your and the
end-customers advantage is to manage the nodes yourself. The reason is the
scaling of cost per CPU.</p>

<p>When renting VMs, the price per CPU often varies for the size of the machine. 
This leaves the reseller flexibility in the choice of resources. To give you an
example, here is the pricing for virtual machines at
<a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>, and the price per CPU:</p>

<p>| Product         | Number of vCPUs    | Price (in €/month) | Price per vCPU (in €/month) |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| CX11            | 1                  | 4.51               | 4.51                        |
| CPX11           | 2                  | 5.18               | 2.59                        |
| CPX21           | 3                  | 8.98               | 2.99                        |
| CPX31           | 4                  | 16.18              | 4.05                        |
| CPX41           | 8                  | 29.99              | 3.75                        |
| CPX51           | 16                 | 65.33              | 4.08                        |</p>

<p>When comparing this to a managed Kubernetes product like
<a href="https://www.civo.com">CIVO</a>, we see that the price per CPU stays constant:</p>

<p>| Product         | Number of vCPUs    | Price (in €/month) | Price per vCPU (in €/month) |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Extra Small     | 1                  | 5                  | 5                           |
| Small           | 2                  | 10                 | 5                           |
| Medium          | 4                  | 20                 | 5                           |
| Large           | 8                  | 40                 | 5                           |</p>

<p>This pricing model is nice and predictable for the customer, but it makes it
impossible to justify a resell product. If CIVO charges 5€/month per vCPU, we
would need to charge extra to be profitable, which in turn overcuts the
competition.</p>

<p>When choosing Hetzner (or any other platform offering VMs), we are still able to
undercut the competition and even optimize how the resources are laid out on
the nodes. The obvious downside of course being that we have to manage the
clusters ourselves.</p>

<h2>Share your thoughts</h2>

<p>Reselling Kubernetes is tricky. I&#39;m currently sketching out ideas for an
alternative way to sell Kubernetes hosting at an ultra cheap price. The project
is still in its infancy but if you&#39;re interested, you&#39;re more than welcome to
share your thoughts in our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!cTXkqtlnbHScIxnlqO:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&amp;via=envs.net">Matrix

<p>For a while now, I wanted to have a quick way to update the pages on my website.</p>

<p>GitHub has the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts#source-code-editing">&quot;.&quot;</a>
hotkey, which opens a web based editor for the file you&#39;re currently viewing.
This site now has this feature as well! To try it out, just hit <code>.</code>, and you&#39;ll
be redirected to the file editor for this page.</p>

<p>To see how I implemented this feature, you take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/commit/658efa3a3ebfebebbf74d0eb6aae6c1cc9566516">this</a>
commit. It boils down to this snippet of code:</p>

<p><code></code><code>js
window.addEventListener(&quot;keypress&quot;, (e) =&gt; {
	if (e.key === &quot;.&quot;) {
		const baseUrl = &quot;https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/edit/main/content&quot;;
		const filePath = window.location.pathname;
		const url = </code>${baseUrl}${filePath}.md`;</p>

<pre><code>	window.location.href = url;
}</code></pre>

<p>});
<code></code>`</p>

<p>Pretty simple, huh?</p>

<p>Since this doesn&#39;t work on mobile devices, I also added <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/commit/8c374a8bc0b66192c454300489fee52e7299c9dd#diff-2cbafea0c9dff483ebab9ad670b1cdb3eb7aac552f9c161e42fee84c2efe3a69">a custom 404
page</a>

                <![CDATA[<p>Docker builds images incrementally. Every line in a Dockerfile will generate a
new image that builds on top of the last one. This can be really handy if
something is not right in your build.</p>

<p>Since version 18.09 Docker has added a new backend for building images,
<a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit#buildkit">buildkit</a>. Unfortunately, buildkit
does not let you view the IDs of the intermediate containers it uses under the
hood. To work around that, you can opt out of buildkit by running a build with
buildkit disabled:</p>

<p><code>sh
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build --pull --rm -t myproject:latest .
</code></p>

<p>You should now see the IDs of the intermediate containers:</p>

<p><code>sh
Sending build context to Docker daemon  87.84MB
Step 1/16 : FROM node:16.15.1-alpine3.16 AS development
16.15.1-alpine3.16: Pulling from library/node
Digest: sha256:c785e617c8d7015190c0d41af52cc69be8a16e3d9eb7cb21f0bb58bcfca14d6b
Status: Image is up to date for node:16.15.1-alpine3.16
 ---&gt; e548f8c9983f
Step 2/16 : WORKDIR /usr/src/app
 ---&gt; Using cache
 ---&gt; 34e5c9bdb910
Step 3/16 : COPY package*.json ./
 ---&gt; Using cache
 ---&gt; 626e4ae998fc
Step 4/16 : RUN npm install glob rimraf
 ---&gt; Using cache
 ---&gt; 2d036b8354e0
Step 5/16 : RUN npm install
 ---&gt; Using cache
 ---&gt; 948709b4957f      &lt;-- HERE
Step 6/16 : COPY . .
...
</code></p>

<p>As mentioned, these IDs are valid docker images, so you can just launch them
and attach a shell like every other image:</p>

<p><code>sh
docker run -ti --rm 948709b4957f
</code></p>

<p>If you&#39;re not seeing a regular shell, but a Node.js REPL for example, this
might be because the <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> of that image was set to the binary of that
REPL. To work around that, you can override the entrypoint:</p>

<p><code>sh
docker run -ti --rm --entrypoint=/bin/sh 948709b4957f
</code></p>

<h2>When is this helpful?</h2>

<p>If your build fails at a particular step, you can attach a shell to the <strong>last
working</strong> step, inspect the filesystem, and execute the failing command manually.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Self-hosting software is not just rainbows and sunshine. I used to self-host a lot of my tools, but after some time the burden of maintaining those tools made me switch to hosted alternatives.</p>

<p>However, there are a few projects that I stuck with over the years, and which I think deserve a deep appreciation.</p>

<h2>Miniflux</h2>

<p><a href="https://miniflux.app/">Miniflux</a> is a very minimal, self-hostable RSS reader. It&#39;s been rock-solid since they day I started using it. The data for the application entirely lives In a Postgres database, which makes migrating the application to new infrastructure setups an absolute breeze. I&#39;ve been meaning to support the author for quite some time now, but the cost of maintaining an instance yourself is basically zero, so I&#39;ve yet to find the time to switch to their paid hosted instance.</p>

<h2>Plausible Analytics</h2>

<p><a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a> is another tool that just keeps on running. I haven&#39;t had any issues with it whatsoever, and I can&#39;t remember the last time I had to do a manual intervention. Just like Miniflux, there&#39;s a paid instance, which supports the author, and just like Miniflux, the software is so good that I haven&#39;t had a reason to switch to it yet. Oh, the irony.</p>

<h2>BirdsiteLIVE</h2>

<p>While my instance of <a href="https://birdsite.slashdev.space/">BirdsiteLIVE</a> is currently in a bad shape, this is not at all the fault of the software. There are limitations to the amount of Twitter API requests you can make, and I did a poor job managing the users on that instance. It&#39;s currently very overloaded and just very few tweets make it through. I will have to set aside some time to fix this, but the software itself has been rock solid since the day I started using it.</p>

<h2>Synapse (Matrix)</h2>

<p>I was hesitant to mention <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> on this list. I had my ups and downs with Synapse (their Python implementation of a Matrix server), but the fact that my instance is still running after multiple infrastructure transitions and even a migration from SQLite to Postgres says something about the quality of the software. I have a feeling that Synapse is fairly resource-hungry, but if you feed it with enough RAM and disk, it will keep running indefinitely.</p>

<h2>Homeassistant</h2>

<p>You can throw <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Homeassistant</a> on a Raspberry Pi and everything works out of the gate. I even migrated my instance from a RPi 3 to a RPi 4 via their backup and restore functionality. It&#39;s absolutely flawless.</p>

<h2>Dead projects</h2>

<p>I think it&#39;s fair to also mention the software that I no longer self-host.</p>

<h3>E-Mail</h3>

<p>Just don&#39;t roll your own email.</p>

<h3>Mastodon</h3>

<p>Too power hungry for my taste. No easy way to host inside docker, which made it a pain to keep running. I&#39;m very happy with <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">Fosstodon</a>, and don&#39;t see a reason to switch to a self-hosted instance any time soon.</p>

<h3>FreshRSS</h3>

<p>I tried replacing Miniflux once, but failed. Nothing beats Miniflux.</p>

<h3>Prometheus + Grafana</h3>

<p>Monitoring <strong><em>inside</em></strong> your infra works until the infra goes down, at which point you&#39;re essentially driving blindfolded. I switched to Grafana Cloud, which includes a very generous free tier.</p>

                Kubernetes is a domain specific database

                <![CDATA[<p>I just finished listening to <a href="https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/129-linkerd/">an
episode</a> of the Kubernetes
podcast. In it, <a href="https://saunter.org/">Thomas Rampelberg</a> makes an analogy that
I think is worth sharing:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;[...] Kubernetes is really a domain-specific database. And you need to look at it
that way. The YAML is literally writing a select statement or an insert
statement for a database. That&#39;s what the YAML is. And it&#39;s awesome that it is
already configured for how it is. And it&#39;s awesome that it&#39;s got a schema. But
the YAML is you writing an insert statement into Kubernetes. [...]&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>The Kubernetes API abstracts two types of states: desired state and actual
state. Whenever you apply a manifest, you update the <em>desired state</em> of the
cluster, just like you do in a regular, non domain-specific database like
PostgreSQL or Redis. Kubernetes then frequently compares the desired state with
the <em>actual</em> state of the cluster. If they don&#39;t match, Kubernetes will do
whatever it does to match these two states. Usually, this data is persisted
using a key-value database like <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a> running in a cluster,
though one could theoretically also hook up an external MySQL or Postgres
database for this purpose.</p>

<p>I found this great diagram by <a href="https://downey.io/blog/desired-state-vs-actual-state-in-kubernetes/">Tim
Downey</a>,
showing an oversimplified analogy of this pattern:</p>

<p>![Thermostat
Example](/assets/posts/2022-09-22-kubernetes-is-a-domain-specific-database/desired-state-hvac-diagram.png)</p>

<p>You <em>insert</em> your desired state into the system, and the system adjusts the
actual state to match the desired state. In the case of thermostats the state is
a temperature. In Kubernetes, it&#39;s <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/">resource
objects</a></p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I recently dove into a new project at work. We&#39;re starting from a blank page,
so of course this classic question came up:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;So should we use tabs or spaces for our formatting?&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>One of my teammates explained to us why the only logical answer to this is
&quot;Tabs&quot;, and you&#39;ll soon know why.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>Most formatters, by default, use either two or four spaces for indentation by
default. The <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> formatter does this, and it
somewhat became the norm for JavaScript projects. This has one huge downside
though: everyone on the team has to agree, or live with this standard.</p>

<p>Nowadays, almost all editors come with the ability to change the preferred
indentation settings, which will be overridden by the settings of the
formatter. I prefer an indentation of 4 spaces, which is reflected in all of my
code. If I&#39;m working on a project that uses an indentation of 2 spaces via
prettier, my preference will be overridden when formatting the code.</p>

<h2>Just use tabs</h2>

<p>The solution to this problem is simple: Create a <code>.editorconfig</code> file and set
the indentation style to tab, without a width:</p>

<p><code></code>`editorconfig
root = true</p>

<p>[*]
end<em>of</em>line = lf
charset = utf-8
indent_style = tab
<code></code>`</p>

<p>Almost all editors will be able to pick this file up and configure some
project-wide settings. If your editor is configured to use a indent width of 4,
this setting will be respected. If you&#39;re a maniac that indents their code with
8 spaces, you&#39;ll be pleased to see that you can finally use this style in your
code, without forcing anyone else to do as you do.</p>

<p>Even GitHub, GitLab and friends are able to respect this setting, giving
everyone the opportunity to view code in their preferred style.</p>

<p>I hope you now know why using a single tab of indentation makes the most sense if
you&#39;re working in a team. Let me know your thoughts!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I just finished migrating a postgres database to a new host. To remember how to
do it next time, I&#39;m writing down the commands I used here.</p>

<p>I usually just shut down the database and then copy the local directory where
the volume was mounted onto the new host. This time though, I seemed to be
getting some I/O errors, so I had to do it the &quot;right&quot; way.</p>

<p>To be fair, this note is based on
<a href="https://www.netguru.com/blog/how-to-dump-and-restore-postgresql-database">this</a>
guide. I modified it to fit my workflow with docker.</p>

<h2>Creating a dump</h2>

<p>Log into the old host:</p>

<p><code>
ssh &lt;user&gt;@host
</code></p>

<p>Connect to the postgres-container:</p>

<p><code>
docker exec -ti myservice_db_1 /bin/bash
</code></p>

<p>Create a dump. You can name your dump as you wish - I&#39;m using dates to
distinguish multiple dumps:</p>

<p><code>
pg_dump -U db_user db_name &gt; db_name_20220531.sql
</code></p>

<p>Copy the dump to the host machine:</p>

<p><code>
docker cp myservice_db_1:/db_name_20220531.sql ~/
</code></p>

<h2>Moving the dump to the new host</h2>

<p>The easiest way to get the dump off of the old server and onto the new one is to
use your local machine as a middleman.</p>

<p>First, download the dump to your machine:</p>

<p><code>
scp &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:~/db_name_20220531.sql .
</code></p>

<p>Then, do the same thing but reversed, with the new host:</p>

<p><code>
scp ./db_name_20220531.sql &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:~/
</code></p>

<h2>Restoring the dump</h2>

<p>First, connect to the new host:</p>

<p><code>
ssh &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Assuming the docker service is already running on the new host, attach to the
db-container, just like above:</p>

<p><code>
docker exec -ti myservice_db_1 /bin/bash
</code></p>

<p>This time, we have to do some fiddling on the database, so attach a session to
postgres using their cli:</p>

<p><code>
psql -U my_user
</code></p>

<p>Before &quot;resetting&quot; the existing DB to apply the dump, we have to connect to
another database. The <code>postgres</code> DB is always there, so you can use that.</p>

<p><code>
\c postgres
</code></p>

<p>Now, we drop the existing DB and re-add it:</p>

<p><code>sql
drop database database_name;
create database database_name with owner your_user_name;
</code></p>

<p>And now, the moment you&#39;ve been waiting for! Leave the psql-session and apply
the dump:</p>

<p><code>
psql -U db_user db_name &lt; db_name_20220531.sql
</code></p>

<p>That&#39;s all! You now have the exact copy of production database available on your
machine.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>My grandpa has been using his current computer for about 10 years now. After
such a long time, the system has become quite slow and bulky. Back then it was
relatively normal to use a HDD as a primary hard drive, which adds to the slow
experience. It was time for an upgrade!</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Use <a href="https://clonezilla.org/">Clonezilla</a> on a live usb stick to
create an exact copy of your old drive onto your new one.</p></blockquote>

<p>I got him a 512 GB SSD, which, conveniently, is the same size of his current
HDD. While installing the new drive alongside his existing one, I thought about
how to copy the existing Windows-installation.</p>

<p>Naïvely, I thought that I could just <code>dd</code> the contents of the HDD onto the new
drive would work, since, <em>every byte is copied as is</em>, or at least that&#39;s what I
thought. Turns out it wasn&#39;t that easy. I&#39;m sure it would&#39;ve worked if I was
more careful, but by default, <code>dd</code> just wipes over each byte, not caring if it
made a mistake. After very long 5 hours, I came back to the PC to see that it
finished copying the 512 GB (yes, it&#39;s not just copying the data, it&#39;s copying
the entire partition!). In a super excited mood, I restarted the PC and selected
the SSD as a boot medium. Aaaaand... nothing. Windows tried to repair some stuff
but it wasn&#39;t successful. I fiddled around with the boot partition a bit, but I
had to give up after an hour or so.</p>

<h2>The second attempt</h2>

<p>After researching a bit (I should&#39;ve done that sooner...) I stumbled across
<a href="https://clonezilla.org/">Clonezilla</a>, a Linux distribution custom-built for
this purpose. I flashed it onto a usb-stick and started the cloning process.
After just 20 minutes (!), it was done cloning the existing data. The process is
extremely simple!</p>

<p>Before rebooting, I disconnected the old drive to make sure that there&#39;s no
funny business going on. Apparently, Windows had to self-adjust UIDs of the
drives, but after a short &quot;Preparing Windows&quot; animation, the system started up
as expected. <strong>Success</strong>!!</p>

<p>The performance of the new hard drive is amazing, at least compared to the HDD
my grandpa had before. Plus, we can use the existing HDD to take full system
backups every now and then, using the same process.</p>

                Swapping two Numbers without Temporary Variables

                <![CDATA[<p>Ever wondered how to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable?</p>

<p>I just found this very old note that I thought is worth sharing. The trick is
quite old and you might already know about this, but when I started out with
programming, it blew my mind.</p>

<p>In school, we get taught to use a temporary
variable to swap two numbers:</p>

<p><code></code>`js
let a = 5;
let b = 10;</p>

<p>let temp = a;</p>

<p>a = b; // a = 10
b = temp; // b = 5
<code></code>`</p>

<p>But by using some arithmetic, we can save us a few bytes of memory:</p>

<p><code></code>`js
let a = 5;
let b = 10;</p>

<p>a = a + b; // a = 15 ; b = 10
b = a - b; // a = 15 ; b = 5
a = a - b; // a = 10 ; b = 5
<code></code>`</p>

<p>Please <strong>never</strong> use this in any production code. The less we have to think
about a piece of code, the better it is. It&#39;s a fun thought experiment
nevertheless!</p>

                Fixing Traefik Proxy Issues

                <![CDATA[<p>After changing my proxy from NGINX to Traefik, I noticed that some of my
services started misbehaving.</p>

<p>In particular, my instance of
<a href="https://github.com/NicolasConstant/BirdsiteLive">BirdsiteLive</a>
(<a href="https://birdsite.slashdev.space">birdsite.slashdev.space</a>) had issues
forwarding tweets to the
<a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2021-01-18-reasons-the-fediverse-is-better">Fediverse</a>.</p>

<p>The only difference between my old NGINX and my Traefik config were the headers.
I didn&#39;t think that that&#39;s what&#39;s causing the issue, but after digging around a
bit I figured out what&#39;s wrong. I still can&#39;t wrap my head around it entirely,
but it has something to do with forwarding external <code>https</code> requests to internal
<code>http</code> services, since the <code>x-forwarded-</code> headers where missing in the forwarded
requests.</p>

<p>In the world of NGINX, we can instruct the proxy to forward <em>all</em> headers using
this directive:</p>

<p><code>conf
proxy_pass_request_headers      on;
</code></p>

<p>which takes care of the issue. In Traefik, it&#39;s a bit more convoluted. Traefik
can use a combination of &quot;Entrypoints&quot; and middleware to route traffic around.
In my setup, I use a <code>webSecure</code> entrypoint listening for SSL/TLS traffic, and a
<code>web</code> entrypoint that just redirects to <code>webSecure</code>:</p>

<p><code></code>`yaml
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: :80
    http:
      redirections:
        entryPoint:
          to: &quot;websecure&quot;
          scheme: &quot;https&quot;</p>

<p>  websecure:
    address: :443
<code></code>`</p>

<p>Apparently, some services send requests to the <code>web</code> entrypoint, and the
<code>x-forwarded-for</code> headers are dropped. To prevent this, you can set the
<code>proxyProtocol</code> and <code>forwardedHeaders</code> in the <code>web</code> entrypoint to <code>insecure</code>,
like so:</p>

<p><code></code>`yaml
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: :80
    proxyProtocol:
      insecure: true
    forwardedHeaders:
      insecure: true
    # ...</p>

<h1>...</h1>

<p><code></code>`</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a reason why this is marked as <code>insecure</code>, but it behaves just
like the NGINX counterpart, so I didn&#39;t bother digging deeper into the matter.
Maybe one day I&#39;ll come back to properly fix this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s super simple!</p>

<p><code>js

<h2>An interesting discovery</h2>

<p>Eventhough I&#39;m using a chromium-based browser, the user-agent and some other
fields of the <code>navigator</code> object imply that I&#39;m running Mozilla Netscape 5.0.
This is a relic of the past, where the user agent heavily influenced the look
and feel of a served website. Nowadays, all rendering engines work more or less
equally, but back then, browsers tried to be as good as the market leader, so
they disquised themselves as Netscape. This podcast episode goes into more
detail about how this developed (jump to minute 3 to listen to this topic):</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I&#39;m currently in the midst of migrating some of my infrastructure from the cloud
to &quot;on prem&quot;, aka a local server, aka my old PC. I wanted to try alpine linux as
the host OS to see how it behaves as a lightweight server distro.</p>

<p>So far it stands up quite nicely, it has everything you&#39;d expect from a
linux-based operating system. The only problem I encountered was getting BTRFS
to work out of the box. Here are some things you should know when using BTRFS on
Alpine linux.</p>

<h3>Installing BTRFS</h3>

<p>Installing BTRFS is relatively straight forward. Simply install the package and
tell Alpine to load the module on startup:</p>

<p><code>
apk add btrfs-progs
echo btrfs &gt;&gt; /etc/modules
</code></p>

<p>To load the module right away, you can use the following command:</p>

<p><code>
modprobe btrfs
</code></p>

<h3>Mounting a volume</h3>

<p>If you try mounting a btrfs volume via your fstab, you will get an error. This
is because BTRFS does not know about the drives yet when the filesystems are
mounted. To work around this, you can create an OpenRC service that runs a
<code>btrfs scan</code> to detect the drives. To do so, create a service under
<code>/etc/init.d/btrfs-scan</code> with the following content:</p>

<p><code></code>`sh</p>

<h1>!/sbin/openrc-run</h1>

<p>name=&quot;btrfs-scan&quot;</p>

<p>depend() {
  before localmount
}</p>

<p>start() {
  /sbin/btrfs device scan
}
<code></code>`</p>

<p>Make the service executable and register it:</p>

<p><code>
chmod +x /etc/init.d/btrfs-scan
rc-update add btrfs-scan boot
</code></p>

<p>Now, you should be able to add the volume to your <code>/etc/fstab</code>:</p>

<p><code>
UUID=abcdef-0055-4958-990f-1413ed1186ec  /var/data  btrfs   defaults,nofail,subvol=@  0  0
</code></p>

<p>After a reboot, you should be able to see the drive mounted at <code>/var/data</code>.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I recently bought a chinese elm bonsai. To keep it alive and healthy, I devoted
some time to learning how to properly prune it.</p>

<p>Chinese elms are very robust trees with strong growth. Even in the winter
season, I can prune it on a weekly basis. I just watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsvc2Ll1X2A">this
video</a> which gives some helpful
tips on pruning.</p>

<p>I noticed that the author let the tree grow heavily to develop stronger
branches. Until now, I pruned the branches back to one leaf whenever it had
about 5 leaves. However, a branch should only be cut on its woody parts in order
to develop more shoots, and a branch needs some growth in order to turn to wood.
<strong>Don&#39;t prune the branches too early</strong>!</p>

<p>Secondly, I thought that cutting the branches just behind a leaf would lead to
more growth, but I found that this is not true. The branches should be cut just
a bit above the leaf to prevent branch to die back and kill the leaf. It could
also lead to the shoot coming out straight instead of angled, which is not
desired.</p>

<p>Lastly I learned that branches pointing upwards should most likely be pruned,
since they take a lot of energy that the tree could use elsewhere, which is also
pointed out in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93c985zOwhs">this video</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a picture of my chinese elm just how I bought it. You can clearly tell
that it was cheaply imported from china. It needs a lot of work, but I&#39;m having
a lot of fun learning about this tree!</p>

                Flutter Web - the Good, the Bad and the Ugly

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<p>These are some notes I took for the evaluation of Flutter web for a potential project at work. I decided to build a frontend for <a href="https://miniflux.app/">Miniflux</a>, since I figured it may enclose many pitfalls an application could potentially have. You can find the current prototype <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/FlutterFlux">here</a>.</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<ul><li><p><strong>Trivial to set up</strong>: Running a Flutter application in a browser, no matter if it is an existing app or a fresh project, can be done by simply specifying the -d chrome flag.</p></li><li><p><strong>Same behavior compared to mobile app</strong>: Since the app is quite literally a mobile application running in the browser, the page looks and feels like a mobile application. It gives the app a consistent look and feel across all devices. I can imagine this coming in handy for web applications that are primarily used on phones and tablets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Browser API integration</strong>: It seems like many of the libraries make use of Web APIs. For example: I was able to get location updates using the location package, and store data using <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/localstorage">localstorage</a>. Whether the Web target is supported, is noted as a flag in the package documentation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Alternative Backends</strong>: There are two <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/web-renderers">rendering backends</a>, both with its own benefits and drawbacks. The HTML renderer optimizes the page for the browser, which improves performance at the cost of consistency. The CanvasKit renderer renders WebGL using WebAssembly. This gives a consistent look and feel across all devices, at the cost of Performance and download size. If auto is specified, the renderer will be determined based on the device type. Here’s a comparison of the same app rendered with both backends:</p></li></ul>

<p>|                    HTML                    |                    CanvasKit                    |
| :----------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------: |
| <img alt="" src="/assets/flutter_web_renderer_html.png"/> | <img alt="" src="/assets/flutter_web_renderer_canvaskit.png"/> |</p>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<ul><li><p><strong>Still in Beta</strong>: Flutter web requires the developer to use the beta channel of Flutter. I didn’t encounter any issues, but it could be that some features are unstable.</p></li><li><p><strong>No native HTML (With an exception)</strong>: Flutter Web renders the application into its own container, which is not using semantic HTML. The resulting application is also not debuggable using standard web-dev tools, but flutters debugging features can be used. There is a workaround though. Using the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/easy_web_view">easy<em>web</em>view</a> package, I was able to embed html components as flutter widgets. The embedded code is actual HTML code that the browser itself is rendering, not Flutter. This solution is cross-platform, meaning that it also works flawlessly for mobile builds of the application. This might come in handy if the project demands to embed a javascript component like a video player. This approach could technically also improve SEO, but I’m unsure how a full-blown application only using this approach would behave.</p></li></ul>

<h2>The Ugly</h2>

<ul><li><p><strong>Scrolling feels sluggish</strong>: The scrolling behavior is implemented by flutter itself and does not feel as smooth as the native scrolling behavior of modern browsers.</p></li><li><p><strong>SEO nearly impossible</strong>: Since the application is a SPA and it is not using semantic HTML, it’s very difficult to do any kind of SEO. Lighthouse rated the demo application with a perfect 100 for SEO, but this is probably because it is only aware of the html that surrounds the flutter container. I didn’t find a way to Inject Metatags on a per-site basis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Heavy and slow on old devices</strong>: Even a basic application like the Todo app is very heavy and slow when compared to a “regular” website.</p></li></ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Flutter Web seems to be a viable candidate to build truly cross-platform applications. Adding Web as a target for existing Flutter mobile apps should be relatively easy. The layout will probably need to be optimized to get the full experience. Native Web APIs seem to be well supported and documented.</p>

<p>The resulting web application is a PWA running inside a container. It is relatively heavy and requires much more resources to run, when compared to a “regular” web application.</p>

<p>I hope you found this useful!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Coming into this, I didn&#39;t know what to expect. I&#39;m not a huge writer, but so far I am pleasantly surprised about how relaxing this challenge is.</p>

<p>At first glance, writing a blog post every 3-5 days seems daunting. But the more I write, the more it becomes an enjoyable habit. I&#39;m oftentimes looking forward to writing these posts. Whenever I have something on my mind, I jot it down without a plan or structure. And that&#39;s exactly the point of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100DaysToOffload</a>: <strong>Just. Write.</strong></p>

<p>So far, these blog posts have helped me get a lot of my thoughts out of my head and onto paper (or on a screen). While writing, I reflect on what I think. I sometimes realize that what I thought is utter nonsense, but this in itself is an important reflection. With each post, I feel like I am getting more confident about the process.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re reading this and you don&#39;t have a blog yet, I would encourage you to give this technique a try. It doesn&#39;t matter that you produce quality content, nor does anyone have to see this. It&#39;s not the content that matters, but the process of producing it. Set up your own blog on <a href="https://write.as/">write.as</a> or simply open your text editor of your choice and <strong>Just. Write.</strong></p>

                <![CDATA[<p>In the coming weeks, months and years, I will be working on frontend-development as part of my dayjob. These are some personal notes I took during my research about the BEM methodology. If you want to read the official introduction, you should visit <a href="http://getbem.com/">their website</a>.</p>

<h1>Overview - What is BEM?</h1>

<p>BEM — Block Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in front-end development. It aims to group css-classes in a meaningful way, making it easier to understand</p>

<ol><li>where this class is used</li><li>what it describes and</li><li>what state the element is in.</li></ol>

<p>The BEM-notation is divided into three main parts: Blocks, Elements and Modifiers.</p>

<h2>Blocks</h2>

<p>A standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. Some examples might be <strong>headers, containers, menus, inputs, checkboxes</strong>, etc.</p>

<h2>Elements</h2>

<p>A part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block. This could be a <strong>menu item or an input placeholder</strong>.</p>

<h2>Modifiers</h2>

<p>A flag on a block or an element. Used to change appearance or behavior. This might be <strong>disabled, checked, fixed, big</strong>, etc.</p>

<h1>Putting it together</h1>

<p>A block itself is referenced though its name.</p>

<p><code>css
.button {
}
</code></p>

<p>To reference elements inside of the block, you add it to the block element with two underscores (<code>__</code>):</p>

<p><code>css
.button {
}
.button__text {
}
</code></p>

<p>If you want to add a modifier to a block or an element, you separate it with two dashes (<code>--</code>):</p>

<p><code>css
.button {
}
.button--disabled {
}
.button__text--inverted {
}
</code></p>

<h1>Benefits of BEM</h1>

<p><strong>Modularity</strong>: Block styles never depend on one another. They can easily be moved to other parts of the app.</p>

<p><strong>Reusability</strong>: Composing styles in a meaningful way reduces the amount of code duplication.</p>

<p><strong>Structure</strong>: BEM gives your code a solid structure that is both easy to understand and to expand.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>For a very long time, the thought of leaving GitHub and moving to another platform daunted me. Having more users on one platforms means that more people will contribute to my project, right? Wrong.</p>

<p>The problem with GitHub is that there&#39;s a lot of things going on around you. How many times have you discovered a cool project on GitHub, starred it and never heard from it again? In essence, this is the same phenomenon as with modern social media. A bombardment of positive stimulants makes the user crave for more, letting them forget about previously consumed content. Sure, if you just want to get your code out there, GitHub might be a great place, but if you are just starting out as a developer and you&#39;re looking for contributers and feedback, you will probably be very bummed to find out that nobody cares about your work. Many developers are using the platform because other developers are using it. Your project on GitHub is a drop in an ocean of other projects.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I decided to make the leap and switch most of my development over to <a href="https://sourcehut.org/">Sourcehut</a>, a free and open source code-hosting platform. Besides its great tooling (mailing lists, automated builds, etc.), it has the benefit of a high <strong>signal-to-noise ratio</strong>. Less developers are using the platform, but most of them are very passionate about their work. They care about collaborating with others and they believe in what they are doing, which probably lead them to sign up for this platform in the first place.</p>

<p>Of course, switching away from a platform like GitHub alone does not ensure more contributions. You might be trying to advertise your projects by spamming links on popular newsboards and forums, but this only generates <strong>noise</strong>. Instead, you should intentionally talk about your personal journey with the project in a smaller circle. If other developers in your niche see that you continuously give updates about the project and its improvements, they will eventually start to relate to it. Some of them will look at your project and give feedback, or even contribute patches.</p>

                6 reasons the Fediverse is better than regular social media

                <![CDATA[<p>Social media sucks. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are designed to turn your precious free time into money. What we see as a nice way to stay in touch with our friends, in reality are just many hits of dopamine stimulating precise spots in your brain, leading to you spending more time on the platform consuming ads.</p>

<p>But what if I told you that there is a huge ad-free social network out there, not governed by a central authority, full of great people and completely free to use? This place is called the fediverse. Well, it&#39;s not really <strong>a</strong> place, it&#39;s many places.</p>

<h2>What is the fediverse?</h2>

<p>At its core, the fediverse is a mesh of interconnected nodes on the internet, all communicating in the same language. Every instance on the fediverse implements the <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a> protocol, which allows it to talk to other instances on the network. The phrase &quot;Fedi&quot; comes from &quot;federated&quot;, meaning that content on the network is shared and accessible by anyone.</p>

<p>There are many different software projects for the fediverse out there. If you like the concept of Twitter, you could take a look at <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, a microblogging-platform for the fediverse. There&#39;s also <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a>, a federated clone of YouTube (PeerTube recently <a href="https://framablog.org/2021/01/07/peertube-v3-its-a-live-a-liiiiive/">released support for peer2peer live streaming support</a>, like what?! 🤯). You like instagram? <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a> got you covered. Of course, there are many other services worth mentioning, so feel free to dig around a bit! As mentioned, the great thing about the fediverse is that all of these services are connected with each other. If I signed up for an account on a mastodon instance, I can subscribe to your posts on Pixelfed, and vice versa. If I want to get notified about your videos on PeerTube, I can just go ahead and follow your account and comment on your videos.</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;This all sounds great, but why should I bother?&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>Let me give you 6 reasons why the fediverse is far superior to all other social media platforms out there, and why you should consider signing up for an account on one of the many instances of the fediverse.</p>

<h2>Reason 1: It&#39;s decentralized</h2>

<p>Regular social media platforms like Facebook have a <strong>single point of failure</strong>. If their servers go down, your content goes down with it. Content on the fediverse on the other hand is scattered around many instances, which means it is very resilient. If your instance dies, you can move to a new instance. This goes hand in hand with the next reason.</p>

<h2>Reason 2: It can&#39;t be censored</h2>

<p>You probably heard that the Twitter-account of Donald Trump recently got compromised by the owners of the platform. I don&#39;t want to engage in any political discussions, but the main flaw with this is the violation of <strong>freedom of speech</strong>. Even if everything someone says is controversial nonsense, it is still in his good right to express his thoughts.</p>

<p>On the fediverse, a scenario like this would certainly not happen, given its decentralized nature. Some instances still moderate their content, meaning that if someone posts inappropriate content, it might get blocked. The twist here is, if that person disagrees with the rules of the instance, he is free to join another instance.</p>

<h2>Reason 3: Free as in freedom</h2>

<p>There&#39;s this saying, criticizing modern software projects:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;If it&#39;s free, you&#39;re the product&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not true in all cases. &quot;Free&quot; can be understood in two ways.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Free as in beer&quot;</strong> means that something might seem free at first glance (E.g. Free beer at Oktoberfest), but in the end you often leave with less than you came with. In the case of beer, you often buy another beer after the first free one. Therefore, even though you think you&#39;ve saved the money for one beer, in reality bought an extra beer. In the case of proprietary software, it&#39;s a similar story. While you think that a service is free, you give up your privacy and get monetized with ads.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Free as in freedom&quot;</strong> on the other hand means that you won&#39;t get &quot;screwed over&quot; like this. Most, if not all of the software for the fediverse is <strong>free and open source software</strong> (FOSS). If you don&#39;t like how a certain feature works, <strong>you are completely free to change it</strong>. You can look at the source code and propose changes to the main project, or launch your own spin of that product.</p>

<p>Since everyone can openly look at the source code, it is <strong>audited</strong> by many people, including security experts. This vastly improves the security and stability of the product. If the developers would do shady things, they will most certainly get called out by people, as soon as that code enters the main repositories. Proprietary (closed sourced) platforms like Facebook and Twitter can not be audited. The owners can do whatever they want, including spying on their users, or collect and sell the data of their users.</p>

<h2>Reason 4: It respects your privacy</h2>

<p>Since the software on the fediverse is audited by a lot of people, you can be almost 100% certain that joining an instance will not collect any of your personal data. If you are still concerned about your privacy though, you can still be part of the network by launching your own instance, with your own rules. There are tutorials out there, explaining how you can set up a small instance for a very cheap price on your local network.</p>

<h2>Reason 5: It&#39;s all about the community</h2>

<p>I used to spend a lot of time on &quot;regular&quot; social media platforms. From personal experiences, these platforms are all about promoting yourself and building up your follower count. Connecting with your friends is of little importance. In the eye of some people, you are not worthy to talk to if the amount of followers or likes-per-post didn&#39;t exceed a certain threshold.</p>

<p>It has now been about 5 months since I created <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@garritfra">my mastodon account</a>. Talking to people on the fediverse is a completely different experience compared to Facebook or Twitter. Almost everyone I talked to is a polite, grounded person, willing to engage in constructive and fun discussions. I met many people who disagree with my views, but instead of leaving a comment saying that this post sucks, all of them took the time to express their alternative opinions. Every member of the fediverse wants to drive the network forward, which is reflected in their posts.</p>

<h2>Reason 6: There&#39;s an instance for everyone</h2>

<p>Whether you&#39;re into Gaming, Painting, or Spanish dancing music, there is an instance for you. If it isn&#39;t, you are free to create one and promote it to people of that niche. You won&#39;t loose the social aspect by launching your own instance, since you are still available to other people on the network. If you just want to get started with the fediverse, I recommend that you check out one of the many <a href="https://instances.social/">lists of mastodon instances</a>. If you like instagram and want to stay in a familiar environment, take a look at <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a>, and join an instance from the list they provide.</p>

<p>I myself am a person who cares a lot about free and open source software, therefore my choice of instance was <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">fosstodon.org</a>, a mastodon instance geared towards awesome like-minded people.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>For some time now, I&#39;ve seen this #100DaysToOffload hashtag on my social medias. I knew that it was some kind of writing challenge, but I never thought about taking part in it. Since I recently started to blog more frequently though, I think this challenge could be very beneficial to my writing skills, and just jotting my thoughts down in general. So, starting with this entry, I will try to publish 100 (hopefully) useful posts on this blog within one year. My &quot;deadline&quot; for this will be January 11, 2022. I will post every entry to <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@garritfra">my mastodon account</a>.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>This is by no means a scientifically accurate article. These are my thoughts, and I&#39;d be happy to discuss this topic. Take it with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Evolution builds upon natural selection. With every generation of a species, there is a slight chance of mutation, possibly giving an individual advantages or disadvantages in the ability to survive and give offspring. Somewhere way up in our evolutionary tree, a microbe might have mutated a gene that allowed it expand and retract a part of its body. As it turns out, this proves useful in fleeing from predators, while other individuals of this species might fall prey on their first day. The microbe has a slightly larger chance to survive and give offspring. On the other hand, mutations might also result in a fatal illness (cancer, in other words). Oftentimes, this individual does not survive long enough to give offspring.</p>

<p>150 years ago, giving birth was literally an act of life and death. Many children died at a young age. They were not tough enough from an evolutionary standpoint, and were therefore &quot;filtered&quot; out by natural selection. Only the strongest survived and gave offspring.</p>

<p>Todays medicine is (fortunately!) very powerful. Very few children die at birth and a lot less people are dying from an illness like the flu. This is an evolutionary anomaly. Natural selection has been defeated to a certain degree. We don&#39;t need to run from predators anymore and are less prone to desease. Every one of us is more or less equally able to give offspring. We can&#39;t really gain an advantage over others anymore. We are not evolving.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I know I should have done this a while ago, but with ever-increasing scandals about data privacy surrounding Facebook, I finally decided to get rid of it.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t used the service in a long time anyway, but I always told myself &quot;what if I needed the data later?&quot;, or &quot;what if a friend contacted me, and I didn&#39;t respond?&quot;, &quot;what if I missed the birthday of someone I&#39;m close with?!&quot;. Well, according to my facebook inbox, the only messages I received lately were some random links from people I&#39;m not really in touch with anymore. Birthdays? Do you think someone you haven&#39;t talked to in over three years will get mad at you, for forgetting their birthday? And regarding your data: you won&#39;t loose it! <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/212802592074644">This guide</a> describes how you can download a copy of your data as html and/or json.</p>

<p>Go ahead and ask yourself: Is there anything holding you back from deleting your Facebook account? What would you loose? How often do you even use the service? Do the social benefits of Facebook <strong>really</strong> outweigh the negative aspects (privacy concerns, data collection, etc.)?</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s christmas season! I hope you and your family are safe and sound. My main focus this month is to expand my knowledge about compilers, by <a href="https://sr.ht/~garritfra/sabre/">building one from scratch</a>. It&#39;s a compiler for a very simple language, but it gets the job done. So far, you can write <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~garritfra/sabre/tree/master/examples">simple algorithms</a>, and compile them to JavaScript. A more sophisticated C backend is in development, but I still need a plan for expanding the target-specific builtin functions to provide more features in the standard library. An important topic at the moment is the <a href="https://garritfra.github.io/sabre/">documentation of the project</a>. Since the compiler itself has gotten relatively stable, all the language-features now need to be captured and written down. There is also a <a href="https://garritfra.github.io/sabre/developers/contributing.html">contributing guide</a>, if you want to help out, or want to get into compiler design.</p>

<p>Stay home and stay safe!</p>]]>

                Booleans are wasted memory

                <![CDATA[<p>A boolean is either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. That translates to <code>1</code> or <code>0</code>. If you think that one bit is enough to store this information, you&#39;d be wrong.</p>

<p>In order to keep the binary layout of a program simple and convenient, most languages store information in 8 bit (1 byte) blocks.
If you allocate a <code>bool</code> in Rust or (most) other languages that are based on LLVM, <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#simple-constants">it will take up 1 <code>i1</code>, or 1 byte of memory</a>. If you allocate a boolean value in C, you will get <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/stdbool.h.html">an integer constant with a value of either 1 or 0</a>.</p>

<p>If you find yourself having to store multiple boolean states somewhere, you might simply declare those booleans and call it a day:</p>

<p><code></code>`c</p>

<h1>include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;</h1>

<h1>include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</h1>

<p>int main()
{
    bool can<em>read = true;
    bool can</em>write = true;
    bool can_execute = false;</p>

<pre><code>if (can_read)
    printf(&quot;read bit set\n&quot;);
if (can_write)
    printf(&quot;write bit set\n&quot;);
if (can_execute)
    printf(&quot;execute bit set\n&quot;);

// Output:
// read bit set
// write bit set</code></pre>

<p>}
<code></code>`</p>

<h2>We can do better than this</h2>

<p>An alternative approach to store boolean values is to share a &quot;chunk&quot; of bits with other values. This is usually done using bitwise operations:</p>

<p><code></code>`c</p>

<h1>include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;</h1>

<h1>include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</h1>

<p>// Define permissions</p>

<h1>define PERM_NONE       0b000</h1>

<h1>define PERM_READ       0b001</h1>

<h1>define PERM_WRITE      0b010</h1>

<h1>define PERM_EXECUTE    0b100</h1>

<h1>define PERM<em>ALL        PERM</em>READ | PERM<em>WRITE | PERM</em>EXECUTE</h1>

<p>int main()
{
    // Allocate 1 byte for permissions
    char permissions = PERM<em>READ | PERM</em>WRITE;</p>

<pre><code>if (permissions &amp; PERM_READ)
    printf(&quot;write bit set\n&quot;);
if (permissions &amp; PERM_WRITE)
    printf(&quot;read bit set\n&quot;);
if (permissions &amp; PERM_EXECUTE)
    printf(&quot;execute bit set\n&quot;);

// Output:
// read bit set
// write bit set</code></pre>

<p>}
<code></code>`</p>

<p>This example still wastes 5 bits since we only use 3 out of 8 possible bits of the char type, but I&#39;m sure you get the point. Allocating 3 boolean values independently would waste 7 * 3 = 21 bits, so it&#39;s a massive improvement. Whenever you find yourself needing multiple boolean values, think twice if you can use this pattern.</p>

<p>Microcontrollers have a very constrainted environment, therefore bitwise operations are essential in those scenarios. 7 wasted bits are a lot if there are only 4 kb of total memory available. For larger systems we often forget about these constraints, until they add up.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Hi, I wanted to share some things I&#39;m currently working on. Maybe I&#39;ll turn this into a monthly thing, who knows. :)</p>

<p>One major goal I set for myself in the upcoming months is to build a SaaS for freelancers. Some features of this will include handling clients, projects and expenses. A thing I&#39;m struggeling with right now it to find a lightweight way to host it. It is currently deployable through docker containers, but I am not 100% satisfied with my current setup. I will give some updates on this in the future. I aim to release a very early alpha version for free soon, so that some people can stress test it extensively. For now, you can of course self-host it. I really don&#39;t want to impose subscription fees for it&#39;s users, but I will see how it goes. You can find the source code for it <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/omega-crm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, I increasingly gained interested in the <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini project</a>. In a nutshell, this is a very minimal alternative to HTTP, with a strong emphasis on simplicity. The maintainers clearly embrace a DIY mindset, which I want to follow. I set myself the rule to only interact with gemini using tools I wrote myself. To achive this, I am currently writing <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~garritfra/taurus">my own Gemini server called &quot;Taurus&quot;</a> to eventually set up my own geminispace. I have not yet looked deeply into building a client, but I might do this once I&#39;m happy with my server. I admit that I&#39;m currently cheating a bit, by testing my server using a browser recommended by the gemini team ;)
If you are interested in this project, I highly recommend to check out the <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.html">gemini specification</a>, and play around with some geminispaces. Maybe you could set up a server for yourself?</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, password managers are a necessity if you care even the slightest about your personal belongings on the interwebs. But think about it, do you really want to trust another company to store your most sensitive information?</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522251670181-320150ad6dab?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2566&amp;q=80"/></p>

<h5>TL;DR</h5>

<p>Use a <strong>stateless</strong> password manager like <a href="https://lesspass.com/">LessPass</a> to access your password without relying on a third party to store your data.</p>

<h2>Why use a password manager in the first place?</h2>

<p>Having a single password for multiple accounts is convenient. What&#39;s also convenient, is <strong>using</strong> this password on multiple accounts once you have access to a single one. What might be convenient to you, might also be convenient to others. Many people, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225163642/http://uk.businessinsider.com/twitter-says-it-wasnt-hacked-passwords-reused-older-hacks-malware-to-blame-2016-6">especially celebrities</a>, fall victim to this trap of comfort.</p>

<p>To counteract this, people are (and should be) using different passwords for different accounts. These passwords differ in a single letter or digit (Twitter: <code>porridge4president</code>, GitHub: <code>poridge5president</code>, etc.), or they don&#39;t match at all (Twitter: <code>porridge4president</code>, GitHub: <code>YouWontGuessThisOne</code>).</p>

<p>The problem that most likely arises from this technique is called <em>password chaos</em> (<a href="https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/password+chaos">Source</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;The confusion that arises when users have many unique passwords.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The aim of a password manager is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-use-password-manager-store-protect-yourself-hackers-lastpass-1password-dashlane-2017-2?r=DE&amp;IR=T">to solve this problem by storing all of your passwords in a single place and securing it with an <em>ultra secure superpassword!</em> (©)</a>. This way, you can use arbitrary passwords - preferebly gibberish that doesn&#39;t make sense to humans (nor machines) - without losing them, as long as you have your <em>ultra secure superpassword!</em> (©) - aka your masterpassword. The benefits are obvious: You get rid of the password chaos problem while staying relatively secure. Eventhough password managers are quite benificial, some people (including myself) see a catch in them.</p>

<h2>Relying on a third party</h2>

<p>Relying on third party companies doesn&#39;t seem like a big deal. After all, you are probably using some form of cloud service to host your photos. Yet there&#39;s a lot of trust involved in letting others handle your private data, especially your passwords. In 2017, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/onelogin-hit-by-data-breached-exposing-sensitive-customer-data/">a major password manager got hacked, exposing sensitive data including users and their passwords</a>. This shows the potential for security breaches in an application that inherently seemed safe. But what if I told you that there is an alternative to this? A password manager that does not store your data at all?</p>

<h2>A Stateless password manager</h2>

<p>Recently, I stumbled across <a href="https://lesspass.com/#/">LessPass</a>. LessPass is a password manager that is very different from what I have seen so far. Instead of storing passwords that either you or a random password generator came up with, it computes passwords on the fly, given a website, username, your masterpassword and some options.</p>

<p><img alt="LessPass" src="../assets/lesspass.gif"/></p>

<p>The key here is that LessPass uses a <strong>pure function</strong>, i.e. a function that given the same parameters will always give the same result. Using this technique, there&#39;s no need to store your password in a database owned by a large company, nor do you have to sync your passwords between your devices (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lesspass.android&amp;hl=de">but there&#39;s an app</a>). The computation happens right on your machine, and <strong>only</strong> on your machine. If you want to find out more about how it works under the hood, you can check out <a href="https://blog.lesspass.com/lesspass-how-it-works-dde742dd18a4#.vbgschksh">the authors blog post</a>. He goes into great detail on what alorithm is used to compute your passwords and how to utilize every feature of LessPass.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Being a little privacy nerd myself, I often think twice about what services I want to use, often even looking into self-hosted alternatives to major products. There are multiple products that offer self hosted solutions to store your passwords, however I also don&#39;t even trust <em>myself</em> with such sensitive data either. LessPass eliminates the need to have a third party watch over your data, let alone to store it on their servers.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>Ever find yourself in a situation where you simply want to save or share the output of a terminal command? Selecting, copying and pasting text from stdout always feels quite tedious, if you just want to share the contents of a file.</p>

<p>A project called <a href="https://termbin.com/">Termbin</a> tries to simplify this process. Just pipe the command you want to save to the following url on port <code>9999</code>, using Netcat:</p>

<p><code>sh
echo &quot;Hello, Blog!&quot; | nc termbin.com 9999
</code></p>

<p>Instead of showing the output, it will be forwarded to Termbin and show the URL, under which your output will be available:</p>

<p><code>sh
➜  blog git:(master) ✗ cat ./some_file.txt | nc termbin.com 9999
https://termbin.com/faos
➜  blog git:(master) ✗
</code></p>

<p>Sure enough, after navigating to <a href="https://termbin.com/faos"><code>https://termbin.com/faos</code></a>, we will see the contents of <code>some_file.txt</code>. Neat!</p>

<h3>⚠️Word of Caution⚠️</h3>

<p>Do not pipe any personal information, credentials or any other private data into termbin. It will be instantly available to the general public, and theres no quick way to remove it.</p>

<p>Happy Pasting!✨</p>]]>
