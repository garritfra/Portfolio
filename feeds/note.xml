                <![CDATA[<p>Planning our week, checking the time, suming up two numbers, reading a book. Often, digital devices are our default answer to a problem at hand. We&#39;ve become so used to being around a computer that we neglect that certain tasks could also be accomplished without it.</p>

<p>Often, we just need to <a href="/posts/2023-06-25-make-a-list">make a list</a>. Many of us have 10 todo-apps on our phone, each with its own bells and whistles. But do we really need those reminder notifications, tags, and priority levels? Most commonly, a pen and paper are all we need to remember what&#39;s on todays agenda.</p>

<p>The next time you&#39;re faced with a foreign problem, try asking yourself if whatever you&#39;re doing is worth the complexity of the solution. Often, though of course not always, the analog solution is most efficient.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Today marks the completion of my second pocket notebook. You may view my <a href="/posts/2023-09-09-everyday-carry-notebooks">About My Pocket Notebook</a> post as part one of this series, since I wrote it near the end of my first notebook. I think it would be interesting to share my experience with this each notebook. One day I&#39;ll maybe have a nice history of posts that I can look back at. üôÇ</p>

<p>This notebook lasted from 2023-09-10 to 2023-10-09, roughly one month. Here&#39;s a picture of it, after living in my back pocket every single day:</p>

<p><img alt="Field Notes #2" src="/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_2.jpeg"/></p>

<h3>What&#39;s in it?</h3>

<p>I used this notebook as a todo list, a travel journal, quick sketches, braindumps, simple calculations and much more. It&#39;s become a place to dump thoughts whenever and wherever I want to. Sometimes, it&#39;s genuinely interesting facts, like how to find north when all you have is a clear night sky.</p>

<p><img alt="Notes on how to find north at night" src="/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_2_page_5.jpeg"/></p>

<p>And sometimes it&#39;s just a random collection of uninteresting thoughts that wouldn&#39;t leave my head.</p>

<p><img alt="Random collection of notes" src="/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_2_page_32.jpeg"/></p>

<p>Some of these notes may mature into a project or blog post, like <a href="/posts/2023-09-29-undo-on-mobile-phones">the second to last note on that page</a>, while others just fade into the abyss. But that&#39;s okay! The point is to get these thoughts out of my head to work with them more easily.</p>

<h3>What&#39;s next?</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll keep on writing! I got a bunch of new FIELD NOTES notebooks to fill up. Since my next notebook will likely live with me through the halloween season, I opted for the <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/harvest">Harvest</a> edition as my next notebook. üéÉ</p>

<p><img alt="Field Notes #3" src="/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_3.jpeg"/></p>

<p>I&#39;m curious to see where this one takes me.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I just finished the book <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary">Project Hail Mary</a> by Andy Weir. Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</p>

<p>I&#39;m completely nerdsniped. I was looking forward to each chapter, eagerly waiting for what will happen next. This book is full of completely unexpected turns, though I never felt lost. The plot is well thought out. Every chapter is like a puzzle piece that perfectly adds to the greater picture.</p>

<p>When I first heard about this book I was a bit skeptical. &quot;Human stranded in space&quot; surely can&#39;t fill some 500 pages (I&#39;m looking at you, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_(2013_film)">Gravity</a>). But having read <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel)#">The Martian</a> some time ago, I knew that Andy Weir&#39;s style of writing would catch me. And catch me he did. The way he describes complex topics completely resonates with me. No matter how unsolvable the problems of the protagonist seem, it&#39;s always an invitation to get your mind blown by the solution.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Close your eyes. Picture yourself standing at a ledge with a rope tied to another ledge that&#39;s 10 steps away. Now, step by step, slowly walk across this rope until you&#39;re at the other side.</p>

<p>I often use this experiment as an indication for how focused I am at a given moment. As easy as this sounds, I rarely make it to the other side. On some days, I can&#39;t even step on the rope before my mind gets distracted and I have to start over. On some other days, I may get a few steps before falling off. With enough practice however, I may get to the other side.</p>

<p>This technique also works very well for short meditation sessions. I close my eyes and try to get to the other side. Whenever I fall off, I try again until my mind is focused enough to walk the entire rope.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious: are you able to walk the entire rope, or are you also struggling to take control over this mindscape?</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Maybe this is just wishful thinking from someone who grew up in front of a physical keyboard, but I sometimes wish that my phone had a global &quot;undo&quot; button.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a reason why phones have evolved away from having such a feature, but sometimes, especially when editing text, it would be very useful to &quot;just hit ctrl-z&quot;, or whatever it would be on a phone. Some apps do have such a button, but they explicitly had to place it there and craft a feature around it.</p>

<p>I can imagine that Android and other OSes are capable of exposing an &quot;undo&quot; API that apps can implement to make this easier. A gesture well known to the user, similar to the &quot;back&quot; button or gesture on Android, would trigger an undo. For text, apps probably won&#39;t even have to implement anything. The Textbox element of the UI framework should be capable of undoing changes. For anything more complex, the app decides what to do with this action.</p>

<p>Again, probably just wishful thinking, but I really want my undos back!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Since about a month, I&#39;ve been carrying a tiny pocket notebook with me wherever
I go. It&#39;s small enough to fit in every pocket imaginable. It doesn&#39;t need to
be recharged, it doesn&#39;t care if it gets wet. It&#39;s just right there whenever I
need it.</p>

<p><img alt="My Notebook on a recent hike" src="/assets/posts/2023-09-09-about-my-pocket-notebook/hike.jpeg"/></p>

<p>As someone living with ADHD, I often find myself overwhelmed by random thoughts and environmental stimuli. Writing my thoughts down on pen and paper helps a lot in those moments, but until now, I&#39;ve yet to come across a technique that stuck with me for an entire month. I take a lot of notes at work and I feel that it helps me stay organized, but I haven&#39;t found a way to use the same technique in my free time. I once tried keeping a notebook in my backpack, but there are moments where I just don&#39;t have my backpack with me, so I neglected it soon after I started.</p>

<p>That all changed when I stumbled across a video titled <a href="https://youtu.be/0xssCfBiUds?si=vxclEs1UxK5tlkL0">&quot;This pocket notebook is (slowly) replacing my phone&quot;</a>. It instantly clicked for me. Carrying a tiny notebook alongside my phone surely can&#39;t be that hard. And indeed, it isn&#39;t! At night, I put the notebook right next to my phone on my desk. After waking up, I grab my phone, and the notebook is right there for me to take as well. It&#39;s become a habit to check if the notebook is there, just like checking your keys when leaving the house.</p>

<p>Phones are optimized to grab your attention whenever and wherever you are. After hours of mindless scrolling through various feeds, I feel like the phone has won the war over me and I begin to feel tired and overwhelmed. Having a notebook always with me, I now get a sense of control over where I&#39;m allocating my attention. Instead of reaching for my phone, I might as well pull out the notebook and scribble whatever is on my mind in that moment. I get to choose what I&#39;m writing down, instead of mindlessly consuming content I&#39;m not even interested in.</p>

<p>In my current notebook, there are lists of things I did on some random day, ideas for side-projects, long paragraphs of unsorted thoughts, stamps I collected during a hike, and bad doodles of trees. It really doesn&#39;t matter <strong>what</strong> I&#39;m writing. It&#39;s about bringing awareness to what&#39;s on my mind.</p>

<h2>Notebook sizes</h2>

<p>I&#39;m still playing around with different sizes of notebooks. So far, I&#39;ve been using a <a href="https://www.moleskine.com/en-us/shop/notebooks/journals/volant-journals/volant-journals-forget-me-not-blue-and-amber-yellow-8058647620541.html">Moleskine Volant XS</a> notebook, which is 6.5 x 10 cm in size. It fits comfortably in the palm of my hand and easily slides in every pocket imaginable. I&#39;d say it&#39;s the perfect size for this purpose!</p>

<p><img alt="My current notebook" src="/assets/posts/2023-09-09-about-my-pocket-notebook/moleskine.jpeg"/></p>

<p>As this notebook comes to an end (it took about a month to fill), I want to try out the slightly larger <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/original-kraft">Field Notes</a> notebook. It&#39;s about 9 x 14 cm and <em>just barely</em> fits in my back pocket. My concern is that it&#39;s too big to carry in tighter pockets, but from what I&#39;ve read online so far, people seem to love this form factor. In my opinion Field Notes have a very unique vibe to them, and although the price is quite hefty (about 15‚Ç¨ for a pack of three, including shipping), they do make it up in style.</p>

<p><img alt="A Field Notes notebook" src="/assets/posts/2023-09-09-about-my-pocket-notebook/field_notes.jpeg"/></p>

<p>Field Notes also have awesome quarterly <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/limited-editions">limited editions</a> that give them an aspect of collectability (just look at their <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/national-parks">National Parks</a> series. They&#39;re gorgeous! ü§§). There&#39;s definetely a lot of hype around them, so if you don&#39;t care about the aesthetics, you can always opt for way cheaper alternatives from your local stationary store (around 2‚Ç¨ or lower).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>After a month of carrying this notebook with me, I do feel that it increased my mental clarity quite a lot. I have a sense of control over my thoughts that I never had before. Whenever I&#39;m sitting down with my notebook and a pen, I instantly notice things around me that I wouldn&#39;t have noticed if I stared at my phone instead.</p>

<p>Notebooks and other so called &quot;EDC&quot; (everyday carry) items are a true rabbit hole (look it up, you&#39;d be surprised), and its easy to get lost in the details. If you&#39;re interested in trying this technique for yourself, just grab whatever tiny notebook you can find and <em>just write</em>.</p>

<p>Apparently, you have a 1 in 302 million chance to win the lottery. Well, that sounds like a lot... but how much is that exactly?</p>

<p>Now, imagine each of these bathtubs is filled to the brim with <strong>rice</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the grains of rice inside one of the bathtubs is painted gold. This is our jackpot.</p>

<p>Whenever you purchase a lottery ticket, imagine grabbing one grain of rice from this sea of bath tubs. Do you think you&#39;d have a chance to find the golden grain?</p>

<p>&quot;Flow&quot; refers to the performance of a system, as opposed to the performance of a specific silo or department.</p>

<p>In our daily work, we often only see what&#39;s inside our own silo. As a developer, we see requirements come in and code going out. In operations, we see code being pushed to a repository and pipelines deploying it to production. However, it&#39;s crucial to understand the flow of work in a broader context.</p>

<p>Most services or products have a &quot;value stream&quot; which describes how work is performed. You can think of the value stream as a carrier belt with multiple work centers. The first work center might be the business department, followed by a design team, a dev team, QA, operations and finally the customer. This structure might look different, depending on what product or service you are building.</p>

<h2>The flow of work should always go in one direction</h2>

<p>Work is typically generated at some point of the value stream. A requirement by the business department, an issue created by the QA team, an incident in operations, feedback from a customer, and so on.</p>

<p>Regardless of where the work originates, the flow of work should always go in one direction: forward. Work moving backwards, or even standing still, introduces bottlenecks that prevent downstream work centers from properly working. Always seek to resolve these bottlenecks as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Always seek to increase flow</h2>

<p>The goal of almost any product or service is to bring value to the customer. More work flowing through the system means more value generated. But how do we increase the flow of work?</p>

<p><strong>Eliminate work in progress</strong>. This almost always indicates a bottleneck in one of the workcenters. Work should always flow smoothly through the system. If a ticket is stuck in one department for too long, ask why and how this can be avoided in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Match the pace of the customer</strong>. If the value stream is pumping out more features than the customer demands, you are not generating value to the business.</p>

<p><strong>Reduce work batch size</strong>. By <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-05-19-work-batch-sizing">iterating in small steps</a>, you can adapt to changes more quickly. Split up requirements into smaller tickets and increase the amount of deployments.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about how to increase flow in a system, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints">theory of constraints</a> and the <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/decoding-the-dna-of-the-toyota-production-system">Toyota production system</a>.</p>

<h2>Never unconsciously pass known defects downstream</h2>

<p>Aim to fix problems immedietely as they occur, especially if it&#39;s higher up in the value stream. Everyone should be responsible for the work of the entire value stream instead of just their work center.</p>

<p>If you notice work or problems being introduced multiple times, it&#39;s likely the upstream work center is unaware of this. Immediately seek awareness and work together on resolving it.</p>

<h2>Never allow local optimization to create global degradation</h2>

<p>Optimizing local work is important, but it should never introduce friction in other workcenters and, by extension, decrease performance of the value stream.</p>

<p>Local optimization is often linked to the &quot;tribal warfare&quot; between organizations (e.g. development vs. operations, business vs. development, etc.).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Understanding and optimizing the flow of work within a value stream is crucial for achieving efficient and effective software delivery. By ensuring that work moves in one direction and continuously seeking to increase the flow, we can generate more value for customers and the business.</p>

<p>Eliminating bottlenecks, matching the pace of the customer, and reducing work batch size are all key strategies to enhance flow. Moreover, actively addressing known defects, promoting collaboration across the value stream, and avoiding local optimizations that hinder overall performance are essential for achieving successful outcomes. By embracing these principles, we can unlock the full potential of DevOps and drive continuous improvement in software delivery processes.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I recently changed roles in my company, and I can officially call myself a &quot;DevOps Engineer&quot; now. But what does that really mean?</p>

<p>In an attempt to write down my thoughts about this topic, I&#39;m starting a series of blog posts called &quot;Principles of DevOps&quot;. I&#39;m usually very bad at sticking to things, so I&#39;m curious to see if this series will lead anywhere.</p>

<p>To collect the posts of this series, I created a tag called <a href="/posts?tags=PrinciplesOfDevOps">#PrinciplesOfDevOps</a>. If you&#39;re reading this in the future, be sure to check out this tag to see all installments.</p>

<h2>What is DevOps?</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s kick off the series with a very basic question: What on earth is DevOps?</p>

<p>DevOps is often used as an inflationary term to describe &quot;whatever comes after dev&quot;. This can&#39;t be further from the truth.</p>

<p>In the past, developers, operations, designers, QA and other stakeholders of an applications were often implicitly trained to work in &quot;silos&quot;. Once designers have finished their job, they pass their mockups to developers. When developers are done writing the application, they pass their code to operations, whose job it is to deploy it.</p>

<p>DevOps is a set of practices that aims to combine the work of project stakeholders to unite people, process, and technology in application planning, development, delivery, and operations. Although the term DevOps only consists of &quot;Dev&quot; and &quot;Ops&quot;, it has since evolved to include design, quality assurance and security. You may have heard of &quot;DevSecOps&quot;, which aims to incorporate more roles into the term, but &quot;DevOps&quot; seems to stick the best with most people.</p>

<h2>What does a &quot;DevOps Engineer&quot; do?</h2>

<p>I recently wrote a blog post about this: <a href="/posts/2023-04-22-the-role-of-a-devops-engineer">The role of a DevOps Engineer</a>.</p>

<p>In short, the job of a DevOps Engineer is to reduce the friction between stakeholders of a project. A collegue of mine explained this in a really good way:</p>

<blockquote><p>A DevOps Engineer doesn&#39;t push the button, they enable the developers to push the button themselves.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Let&#39;s jump in!</h2>

<p>I hope by now you have a vague sense of what DevOps is. Next up, I want to uncover the principles and practices of DevOps. Thanks for reading to the end!</p>
