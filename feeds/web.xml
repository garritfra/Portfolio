                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This is a reply to Tony Mottaz&#39; <a href="https://www.tonymottaz.com/code-for-computers-and-humans/">blog post</a> about code that&#39;s easy to understand for humans.</p></blockquote>

<p>The understandability of a piece of code can be measured by how much time one needs to grasp its behavior. Less cognitive load usually means easier, and therefore faster, to understand.</p>

<p>Tony argues that the verbose version of the code (<code>isNaN(defaultValue) ? NaN : defaultValue;</code>) is better than the optimized version (<code>defaultValue;</code>) because it proves that the author has thought of the possible sideeffect.</p>

<p>However, I personally think this is in fact bad code. Although the code is <strong>trying</strong> to make obvious what it&#39;s doing, Tony had to pause and think about why it&#39;s written this way. This probably interrupted their flow of work, which is highly undesired. A short comment should have the same effect while keeping the reader in their flow. This is a perfect example for the &quot;<a href="https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/code-comments-why-not-how/">comment the why, now the how</a>&quot; mantra.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed Tony&#39;s post. It does a great job emphasizing that we should be curious about the code we read and write.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>My latest project, <a href="https://sendpasswords.net/">sendpasswords.net</a> is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA">Single Page Application</a> deployed on GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>GitHub Pages is configured in a way to host static HTML files without any bells and whistles. This means that if you try to fetch a document that&#39;s <em>not</em> the index, for example <code>/foo</code>, the server will try to load the file with that name. </p>

<p>By nature, SPAs only consist of a single HTML entry point (<code>index.html</code> in most cases). It&#39;s responsible for routing the user to the correct page if there are multiple paths. And here&#39;s the crux: if the user tries to load <code>/foo</code>, he will not land at the SPA entry point. Instead, he will see a <code>404</code> error.</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>A <code>404</code> response will automatically return a file called <code>404.html</code>, which we can use to our advantage. After building the application, simply copy the <code>index.html</code> to <code>404.html</code>, as demonstrated by <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/sendpasswords.net/commit/66bdb68c229a3ac3386f7816a746155e658eb586">this commit</a>. This will use <code>index.html</code> to serve the application on the root level, and <code>404.html</code> to load <em>the same app</em> if the page doesn&#39;t exist as a file. Whether the <code>index.html</code> is needed if there&#39;s already a <code>404.html</code> is up to you. I left it in to make clear that this is just a workaround.</p>

<p>This is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/69308662/9046809">well known</a> workaround, but I wanted to bring some extra awareness to it, since it&#39;s a problem I ran into a couple of times so far. Happy SPAing!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Thanks to <a href="https://jacksonchen666.com/">Jacksons</a> <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/darktheme.club/pull/79">update to darktheme.club</a>, I just came across a neat little <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme">CSS property</a> that turns a mostly CSS-free document into a pleasantly dark site:</p>

<p><code>css
:root {
  color-scheme: light dark;
}
</code></p>

<p>This will adjust all elements on the page to the color scheme preferred by the user - without any other custom styles! ðŸ¤¯ It is also <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_color-scheme">widely supported</a> by browsers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been quite dependent on CSS-frameworks for any project I&#39;m starting. Going forward, I&#39;d be interested to see how framework-less sites would feel using this property. If all else fails, there&#39;s always the awesome <a href="https://simplecss.org/">simple.css</a> library, which you can slap on top of a raw document to make it pretty (and dark, if preferred) without using custom classes.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I commonly used to create a <code>.Dockerignore</code> file next to my <code>Dockerfile</code>. After countless hours of ignoring the problems in my setup, I found out that the uppercase <code>.Dockerignore</code> doesn&#39;t get picked up by Docker on MacOS. Only the lowercase <code>.dockerignore</code> is valid.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t find official documentation on this, but I think it&#39;s because both MacOS and Linux are case-sensitive, while Windows isn&#39;t. I don&#39;t remember why I got used to the <code>.Dockerignore</code> convention, but I swear I saw someone using it in the wild. Or it&#39;s my (un)logical reasoning that, because <code>Dockerfile</code> is uppercased, <code>.Dockerignore</code> should be uppercased as well.</p>

<p>Either way, stay away from <code>.Dockerfile</code>s and stick to <code>.dockerfile</code>s.</p>

<p><code>css
.foo { 
  top: 0;
  right: 0;

}
</code></p>

<p>you can just use:</p>

                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>Warning</strong>: This is a rather ranty post. I just needed a place to dump my emotions about this topic. Please take it with a grain of salt. :)</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m currently <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/ua-parser-js/pull/8">fiddling
around</a> with User-Agents of
Smart TVs, or more specifically <a href="https://www.hbbtv.org/">HbbTV</a>. Interpreting
them is an absolute nightmare, so let me rant about interesting edge-cases I
discovered along the way.</p>

<p>To set the mood: User-Agents in this field have a standardized format, yet many
vendors seem to do their own thing, making it impossible to build one parser to
rule them all. For reference, here&#39;s what the HbbTV section in a user agent
SHOULD look like:</p>

<p><code>
HbbTV/&lt;version&gt; (&lt;capabilities&gt;; &lt;vendorName&gt;; &lt;modelName&gt;; &lt;softwareVersion&gt;; [&lt;hardwareVersion&gt;]; &lt;familyName&gt;; &lt;reserved&gt;)
</code></p>

<h2>The &quot;we&#39;ll update that later&quot;</h2>

<p><code>
HbbTV/1.1.1 (; Loewe; MB180; 1.0; 1.0;) NetFront/4.1
</code></p>

<p>1.0 for both software and hardware versions suspiciously looks like a working
title. At least we get some information about the vendor and the model.</p>

<h2>The Overcommitted</h2>

<p><code>
Mozilla/5.0 (Linux armv7l) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.143 Safari/537.36 OPR/40.0.2207.0 OMI/4.9.0.237.DOM3-OPT.245 Model/Vestel-MB211 VSTVB MB200 HbbTV/1.2.1 (; JVC; MB211; 3.19.4.2; _TV_NT72563_2017 SmartTvA/3.0.0
</code></p>

<p>It&#39;s nice that we get a lot of information about the device, yet no one seemed
to check if the string actually fits into storage.</p>

<h2>The Lazy Boy</h2>

<p><code>
HbbTV/1.1.1 (;;;;;) Maple;2011
</code></p>

<p>To be fair, this is one of the earliest HbbTV devices ever. No one knew that
this technology would stand the test of time. Apparently not even Samsung.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I learned that building a generic parser for user agents isn&#39;t easy, especially
if the devices you work with could be over a decade old.</p>

<p>One thing that all devices do seem to get right though is the presence of the
HbbTV section in the User-Agent. I did not encounter a single device without it.</p>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<p>After changing my proxy from NGINX to Traefik, I noticed that some of my
services started misbehaving.</p>

<p>In particular, my instance of
<a href="https://github.com/NicolasConstant/BirdsiteLive">BirdsiteLive</a>
(<a href="https://birdsite.slashdev.space">birdsite.slashdev.space</a>) had issues
forwarding tweets to the
<a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2021-01-18-reasons-the-fediverse-is-better">Fediverse</a>.</p>

<p>The only difference between my old NGINX and my Traefik config were the headers.
I didn&#39;t think that that&#39;s what&#39;s causing the issue, but after digging around a
bit I figured out what&#39;s wrong. I still can&#39;t wrap my head around it entirely,
but it has something to do with forwarding external <code>https</code> requests to internal
<code>http</code> services, since the <code>x-forwarded-</code> headers where missing in the forwarded
requests.</p>

<p>In the world of NGINX, we can instruct the proxy to forward <em>all</em> headers using
this directive:</p>

<p><code>conf
proxy_pass_request_headers      on;
</code></p>

<p>which takes care of the issue. In Traefik, it&#39;s a bit more convoluted. Traefik
can use a combination of &quot;Entrypoints&quot; and middleware to route traffic around.
In my setup, I use a <code>webSecure</code> entrypoint listening for SSL/TLS traffic, and a
<code>web</code> entrypoint that just redirects to <code>webSecure</code>:</p>

<p><code></code>`yaml
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: :80
    http:
      redirections:
        entryPoint:
          to: &quot;websecure&quot;
          scheme: &quot;https&quot;</p>

<p>  websecure:
    address: :443
<code></code>`</p>

<p>Apparently, some services send requests to the <code>web</code> entrypoint, and the
<code>x-forwarded-for</code> headers are dropped. To prevent this, you can set the
<code>proxyProtocol</code> and <code>forwardedHeaders</code> in the <code>web</code> entrypoint to <code>insecure</code>,
like so:</p>

<p><code></code>`yaml
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: :80
    proxyProtocol:
      insecure: true
    forwardedHeaders:
      insecure: true
    # ...</p>

<h1>...</h1>

<p><code></code>`</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a reason why this is marked as <code>insecure</code>, but it behaves just
like the NGINX counterpart, so I didn&#39;t bother digging deeper into the matter.
Maybe one day I&#39;ll come back to properly fix this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s super simple!</p>

<p><code>js
const userLang = navigator.language || navigator.userLanguage;
</code></p>

<h2>An interesting discovery</h2>

<p>Eventhough I&#39;m using a chromium-based browser, the user-agent and some other
fields of the <code>navigator</code> object imply that I&#39;m running Mozilla Netscape 5.0.
This is a relic of the past, where the user agent heavily influenced the look
and feel of a served website. Nowadays, all rendering engines work more or less
equally, but back then, browsers tried to be as good as the market leader, so
they disquised themselves as Netscape. This podcast episode goes into more
detail about how this developed (jump to minute 3 to listen to this topic):</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Here&#39;s a useful react hook for situations where you have to keep track of the
state of a dialog, popup, etc.:</p>

<p><code></code>`js
import { useState } from &quot;react&quot;;</p>

<p>export default (value) =&gt; {
	const [state, setState] = useState(value);</p>

<pre><code>const setStateActive = () =&gt; {
	setState(true);
};

const setStateInactive = () =&gt; {
	setState(false);
};

return [state, setStateActive, setStateInactive];</code></pre>

<p>};
<code></code>`</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p><code></code>`js
const SomeComponent = () =&gt; {
	const [isDeleteDialogOpen, openDeleteDialog, closeDeleteDialog] =
		useToggle(false);</p>

<pre><code>return (
	&lt;&gt;
		&lt;Button onClick={openDeleteDialog}&gt;Open Delete Dialog&lt;/Button&gt;
		&lt;Dialog isOpen={isDeleteDialogOpen} onClose={closeDeleteDialog}&gt;&lt;/Dialog&gt;
	&lt;/&gt;
);</code></pre>

<p>};
<code></code>`</p>
