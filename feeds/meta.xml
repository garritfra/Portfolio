                <![CDATA[<p>This marks post 100 of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com">#100DaysToOffload</a>. These last couple of days, I&#39;ve been sprinting towards the finish line with one post every day to finish the challenge until the end of the year. And I finally made it!</p>

<p>I started this challenge with <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2021-01-11-100daystooffload">this</a> post on January 11th, 2021, which means it took me almost three full years to finish it. The original challenge was to write 100 posts in <strong>one</strong> year, so I&#39;m way overdue. üòÖ But that doesn&#39;t make me less proud to finish it!</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested, you can find the list of all 100 of my posts <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts?tags=100DaysToOffload">here</a>.</p>

<h2>What I learned</h2>

<p>Before starting this challenge, I sometimes struggled with putting out content on this blog. It felt like each post had to be perfect, and if it wasn&#39;t, I was scared to publish it.</p>

<p>The idea of #100DaysToOffload is to let go of this fear and <em>Just. Write.</em> This absolutely worked. I accepted the fact that not every post is perfect and <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-04-01-quality-vs.-quantity">sometimes posting more often with worse quality makes way for better posts</a>.</p>

<p>In order to post more often, I also found ways to reduce the friction between me writing a text and publishing it to the blog. I&#39;ve yet to cover this in a post, but I built myself <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish_via_issue.yaml">a handy script</a> that turns the contents of a GitHub issue into a pull request, ready to be merged as a blog post. This enables me to write posts everywhere I want (like the one right now, which is written on my phone), instead of having to open my laptop, create a new file, write the post and commit it to the repository.</p>

<h2>What&#39;s next?</h2>

<p>I will continue posting when I feel like it! I set myself the goal to publish at least 50 posts a year, but that&#39;s just a rough estimate. If I don&#39;t feel like blogging, I won&#39;t force myself to do it.</p>

<p>All in all, I&#39;m very thankful for having taken part in this challenge. I met <a href="https://kevquirk.com/">a</a> <a href="https://joelchrono.xyz/">bunch</a> <a href="https://claytonerrington.com/">of</a> <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/">like-minded</a> <a href="https://jlelse.blog/">folks</a> that are happy to discuss whatever I&#39;m rambling about, and it&#39;s great to read whatever they are rambling about as well! I&#39;m also thankful for all the nuggets of information I got to share with you, and also with my future self (seriously, you won&#39;t believe how often I&#39;m looking up old posts and being happy that I wrote that down!).</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, until next time!</p>

                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This is a reply to Simone Silvestroni&#39;s <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/giving-context-to-a-blogroll/">blog post</a> about blogrolls, which itself is a reply to a <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-12-12-roast-my-site">call for feedback</a> for my site.</p></blockquote>

<p>Simone argues that Blogroll entries without an explaination are just random links with a name. The reader doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s behind those links and therefore doesn&#39;t benefit from the blogroll. It would be better to give some context to the entries by explaining why they are on this list.</p>

<p>I absolutely support this idea. In response, I added context to all of my <a href="/blogroll">Blogroll</a> entries. I hope this helps you discover more awesome content on the web. Also, if you know a website that might fit on this list (maybe your own?), feel free to <a href="/contact">let me know</a>. I&#39;d be happy to read it!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re subscribed to this blog via <a href="/rss.xml">RSS</a>, you will soon likely see
a bunch of my posts re-appearing in your feed. For that, I apologize in advance!</p>

<p>I&#39;m planning to make two modifications. Firstly, I want to add a <code>id</code> property
to all entries. So far, your reader has been likely been relying on the URL slug
to identify an entry. Adding the <code>id</code> property makes this more flexible, but it
also means that your reader will think that there are new entries in the feed.
This will only happen once.</p>

<p>Secondly, I want to reduce the amount of the entries. If you look at the
<a href="/rss.xml">feed</a>, you&#39;ll see a lot of junk from way back, containing every word
I wrote on this blog. Remember that this page is fetched periodically (usually
every hour for most readers) by <strong>every</strong> subscriber. That&#39;s a lot of traffic
that could be better put to use somewhere else. Not that it costs me anything -
this site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> - but if this
helps reduce the carbon footprint of the site even by one gram, it&#39;s worth the
effort.</p>

<p>As of the time of writing this post, by restricting the number of posts to 10,
we reduce the amount of traffic per client per hour from 272 kB down to to 24
kB. That&#39;s over <strong>2 GB</strong> of traffic saved each year <strong>per subscriber</strong>!!</p>

<p>That&#39;s all - just a heads up. Thanks for your patience, you&#39;re awesome! ‚úåÔ∏è</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>The amount and quality of the posts on this blog strongly depends on my mood. Some times I want to write about every thought that crosses my mind, leading to 4+ average- to low-quality posts a week. I think I&#39;m in one of these phases right now.</p>

<p>Some other times, I feel like most of my thoughts are not worth the effort to write about, but the ones that I <strong>do</strong> write about, often become the ones that I&#39;m <a href="/posts/2021-04-07-pgp-guide">most</a> <a href="/posts/2021-10-04-server-side-caching-with-apollo-graphql">proud</a> <a href="/posts/2021-01-18-reasons-the-fediverse-is-better">of</a>.</p>

<p>These phases act like opposing forces that coexist very well. Pumping out more thoughts of lesser quality frees up my mind for higher quality ones, and when I&#39;m writing about higher quality thoughts, I get the urge to write more often, completing the circuit.</p>

<p>In the end, it&#39;s not about <strong>what</strong> you write about, but about the process of writing itself. Every post on a personal blog is <a href="https://kevquirk.com/thoughts-on-editing-posts/">a snapshot of your thoughts at a point in time</a>, no matter if you&#39;re feeling qualitative or quantitative.</p>

                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Click <a href="/guestbook">here</a> to view the guestbook.</p></blockquote>

<p>For a while now, I wanted to have a quick way to update the pages on my website.</p>

<p>GitHub has the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts#source-code-editing">&quot;.&quot;</a>
hotkey, which opens a web based editor for the file you&#39;re currently viewing.
This site now has this feature as well! To try it out, just hit <code>.</code>, and you&#39;ll
be redirected to the file editor for this page.</p>

<p>To see how I implemented this feature, you take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/commit/658efa3a3ebfebebbf74d0eb6aae6c1cc9566516">this</a>
commit. It boils down to this snippet of code:</p>

<p><code></code><code>js
window.addEventListener(&quot;keypress&quot;, (e) =&gt; {
	if (e.key === &quot;.&quot;) {
		const baseUrl = &quot;https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/edit/main/content&quot;;
		const filePath = window.location.pathname;
		const url = </code>${baseUrl}${filePath}.md`;</p>

<pre><code>	window.location.href = url;
}</code></pre>

<p>});
<code></code>`</p>

<p>Pretty simple, huh?</p>

<p>Since this doesn&#39;t work on mobile devices, I also added <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/commit/8c374a8bc0b66192c454300489fee52e7299c9dd#diff-2cbafea0c9dff483ebab9ad670b1cdb3eb7aac552f9c161e42fee84c2efe3a69">a custom 404
page</a>
which also redirects to the editor, if the filepath ends with in <code>/edit</code>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s have some fun and put this feature to use. I added a simple
<a href="/guestbook">guestbook</a> to this site, which is open to receive pull requests.
I&#39;d love to hear from you!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Coming into this, I didn&#39;t know what to expect. I&#39;m not a huge writer, but so far I am pleasantly surprised about how relaxing this challenge is.</p>

<p>At first glance, writing a blog post every 3-5 days seems daunting. But the more I write, the more it becomes an enjoyable habit. I&#39;m oftentimes looking forward to writing these posts. Whenever I have something on my mind, I jot it down without a plan or structure. And that&#39;s exactly the point of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100DaysToOffload</a>: <strong>Just. Write.</strong></p>

<p>So far, these blog posts have helped me get a lot of my thoughts out of my head and onto paper (or on a screen). While writing, I reflect on what I think. I sometimes realize that what I thought is utter nonsense, but this in itself is an important reflection. With each post, I feel like I am getting more confident about the process.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re reading this and you don&#39;t have a blog yet, I would encourage you to give this technique a try. It doesn&#39;t matter that you produce quality content, nor does anyone have to see this. It&#39;s not the content that matters, but the process of producing it. Set up your own blog on <a href="https://write.as/">write.as</a> or simply open your text editor of your choice and <strong>Just. Write.</strong></p>

                <![CDATA[<p>JavaScript rules the web, literally. In fact, this website is built with JavaScript (Next.js). I recently started to think about if I really needed this much overhead for a simple site like this. After all, I don&#39;t have any fancy user interaction features or complex animation that would justify the JavaScript on this page.</p>

<p>There is a new (no, not that new) philosophy called <a href="https://leanweb.dev/">the lean web</a>. It essentially tries to keep websites tiny and semantically correct. This has many benefits, ranging from less pollution generated by your site to improved SEO, since many search engines favor a semantically correct website over a site that abuses JavaScript to mimic the features, that are baked into html anyway.</p>

<p>In order to get lean, I decided to join <a href="https://512kb.club/">the 512KB club</a>. This website lists sites that are below 512KB in total (uncompressed, with all dependencies). To get below that mark, I had to remove my face from the frontpage (I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll miss itüòÖ), since the image itself was roughly 750KB. I&#39;m now just below 500KB, which qualifies me to join the blue team.</p>

<p><a href="https://512kb.club"><img alt="Blue Team" src="https://512kb.club/images/blue-team.svg"/></a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not planning to stop here though. I think keeping a website small and simple is an excellent practice. My next step will be to get rid of all the JS junk on this site and only rely on HTML and CSS. I still want to be able to write my posts in Markdown, so I will have to come up with a way to generate pages from them. A safe bet for this would be to use a SSG like <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. Frankly, <a href="https://erikwinter.nl/articles/2020/why-i-built-my-own-shitty-static-site-generator/">writing my own simple SSG probably wouldn&#39;t hurt either</a>. Let&#39;s see how high I can climb the ranks of the 512KB club. Care to join me?</p>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<p>Hi! Welcome to the new home of my blog. Let me give you a small tour of why I built it, its underlying architecture and my ambitions with this project.</p>

<p>My old blog was based on <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby.js</a>, a static site generator built on React. Back then, I used a quick and dirty blogging template I stole from the Gatsby themes page. Gatsby themes are essentially npm packages, that you throw in your project as a dependency. While it was super easy to set up, I had a hard time configuring it to my likings, since I relied on a framework someone else has provided.</p>

<p>The real turning point came, when I tried to build the blog after a few months of not maintaining it. I wasn&#39;t able to compile it, since some dependency of the blog template broke. Of course I could have forked the template and fixed it to my likings, but I didn&#39;t want to maintain yet another library until the end of my blogs life. You could draw some parallels to propriotary software, where you don&#39;t have the chance to look under the hood and see what&#39;s wrong, except in this case, it was just me being lazy.</p>

<h2>A new approach</h2>

<p>What I want is a project that I have full control over. I want to be able to customize styling and add features whenever I want to. Gatsby would have been able to give me all of this, but I have the feeling that it sometimes overcomplicates things too much (Having a GraphQL backend is nice, but do you really need that?). I looked at frameworks like <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> which offers lightning fast compilation, but with it, I would have been tied to &quot;the Hugo way&quot; of templating and configuring the project.</p>

<p>In the end it was <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> that caught my attention the most, given how simple it is. There&#39;s not much configuration involved in the setup process (although getting it to work with github pages was somewhat tedious). Each component in the <code>pages/</code> directory corresponds to a full page on the website. The <code>public/</code> directory is served statically. That&#39;s really all I needed to build a modular webpage.</p>

<h2>Wiring things up</h2>

<p>Because Next.js is so minimalistic, there are some parts that you have to set up by yourself. Rendering markdown files for example does not come included, it has to be done manually. Thankfully, there are some packages that can do this for you. All you have to do is write the markdown to the specific pages. It basically boils down to this:</p>

<p><code></code>`js
const posts = ((context) =&gt; {
	const keys = context.keys();
	const values = keys.map(context);</p>

<pre><code>const data = keys.map((key, index) =&gt; {
	// Create slug from filename
	const slug = key
		.replace(/^.*[\\\/]/, &quot;&quot;)
		.split(&quot;.&quot;)
		.slice(0, -1)
		.join(&quot;.&quot;);
	const value = values[index];
	// Parse yaml metadata &amp; markdownbody in document
	const document = matter(value.default);
	return {
		frontmatter: document.data,
		markdownBody: document.content,
		slug,
	};
});
return data;</code></pre>

<p>})(require.context(&quot;../content/posts&quot;, true, /.md$/));
<code></code>`</p>

<p>Another special case was setting up a RSS feed. I basically had to write a simple script that generates the feed from all posts in the <code>content/posts</code> directory, let it run during every build and throws the output in the <code>public/</code> directory, so that it can be served as <code>/rss.xml</code>. You might argue that this is quite a tedious process for such a feature, but it gives me all the flexibility I want over the features of this project.</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve considered self hosting this blog on my server. While that would have been a fun learning-experience, I wanted to stick to the simple deploy-and-forget workflow I was used to from GitHub Actions. Every push to the master branch triggers a full deployment. No manual work required. Doing it this way, I also save the time and energy to set up SSL encryption, plus it is highly scalable (not that I expect a traffic-explosion, but you never know). Setting Next.js up to deploy to GitHub Pages takes some time, because there are some pitfalls that you have to be aware of. <a href="https://dev.to/jameswallis/deploying-a-next-js-app-to-github-pages-24pn">This article</a> helped me a lot.</p>

<h2>Ambitions</h2>

<p>In the future, I want /dev.space to become more than just a blog. I want it to become a platform for my thoughts and ideas. I&#39;m also playing with the idea to migrate my main website (https://garrit.xyz) over to /dev.space, therefore made sure that my current setup is very future-proof and can be easily extended.</p>

<p>Feel free to dig through the source code for this project. You can find it on my GitHub: https://github.com/garritfra/slashdev.space</p>

<p>Let me know if there is anything that you miss on this blog. Searchable posts? Dark-mode? This is only the beginning of /dev.space!</p>]]>
