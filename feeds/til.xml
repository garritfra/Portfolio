                <![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve always been wondering why dividing by zero is considered undefined. My intuitive answer would have always been &quot;infinity&quot; or &quot;zero&quot;. I just had a discussion about this with a collegue who happens to have a degree in mathematics, and the way they explained it made it absolutely clear why it doesn&#39;t make sense to divide by zero.</p>

<h2>Inverse Operations</h2>

<p>Before understanding why dividing by zero is undefined, you first need to know about inverse operations. It&#39;s quite simple!</p>

<p>An example: <code>3 + 2 = 5</code>. The inverse of addition is <em>subtraction</em>, so the inverse of this equasion is <code>5 - 2 = 3</code> or <code>5 - 3 = 2</code>.</p>

<p>The same applies to multiplication. The inverse of multiplation is <em>division</em>. So the inverse of <code>6 * 2 = 12</code> is <code>12 / 2 = 6</code> or <code>12 / 6 = 2</code>.</p>

<h2>Dividing by zero</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s try to apply the inverse rule to the number zero, starting with addition. If <code>2 + 0 = 2</code>, then <code>2 - 0 = 2</code>.</p>

<p>But if we have <code>2 * 0 = 0</code>, the inverse of that would be <code>0 / 0 = 2</code>, which is just not true.</p>

<p>Dividing by zero breaks some fundamental laws of mathematics, which is why there&#39;s a general consensus that any equasion dividing by zero has no valid answer.</p>

                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: This post stirred up some interesting discussions on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38110286">HackerNews</a> and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/gnv9ho/tracking_sqlite_database_changes_git">Lobste.rs</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>SQLite stores data in binary. If you run <code>cat mydb.sqlite</code>, you&#39;ll see a bunch of gibberish that doesn&#39;t resemble structured data at all. If you want to track changes and updates to a database using Git, you won&#39;t be able to see full diffs by default. You&#39;ll see that the file has changed, but not what changed exactly:</p>

<p><code>diff
diff --git a/mydb.sqlite b/mydb.sqlite
index f412c72..8f49ea5 100644
Binary files a/mydb.sqlite and b/mydb.sqlite differ
</code></p>

<p>So, is there a way around that? Turns out: there is! Here&#39;s a diff between two states of the SQLite database of <a href="https://www.gnucash.org/index.phtml">GnuCash</a>, which I&#39;m currently trying out to manage my finances. I&#39;ll explain how I got this diff afterwards:</p>

</code></p>

<p>First, add a diff type called &quot;sqlite3&quot; to your config. The simplest way is to just run these commands:</p>

<p><code>shell
git config diff.sqlite3.binary true
git config diff.sqlite3.textconv &quot;echo .dump | sqlite3&quot;
</code></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can add this snippet to your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> or <code>.git/config</code> in your repository:</p>

<p><code>gitconfig
[diff &quot;sqlite3&quot;]
        binary = true
        textconv = &quot;echo .dump | sqlite3&quot;
</code></p>

<p>Next, create a file called <code>.gitattributes</code> if it&#39;s not already present and add this line:</p>

<p><code>gitattributes
*.sqlite diff=sqlite3
</code></p>

<blockquote><p>Note that the filename (<code>*.sqlite</code>) may differ from your setup. In my case for example, it should match files with <code>*.gnucash</code>.</p></blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s about it! The next time you run <code>git diff</code> or any other command that produces a diff on a sqlite file, you&#39;ll see a nicely formatted diff of the changes.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Here&#39;s a quick tip on how to manage multiple Git identities (e.g. personal, work, client1, client2).</p>

<p>I organize my Git repos in three levels. My personal projects live in a <code>~/sources</code> directory. All my work projects live in <code>~/work</code>. This is the first level.</p>

<p>Level 2 is the client, e.g. <code>~/work/client1</code>. Naturally, level 3 is the project repository: <code>~/work/client1/foo-api</code>.</p>

<p>This is how my work directory is organized:</p>

<p><code>
/Users/garrit/work
├── client1
│   ├── foo-api
│   ├── foo-ios
│   └── foo-android
└── client2
    ├── bar-ios
    └── bar-middleware
</code></p>

<p>Now, say that <code>client2</code> demands that we commit with a different identity than our default work email. Besides that, you probably also have a personal email address for your own projects. How do you manage that?</p>

<h2>.gitconfig includes</h2>

<p>The global configuration file for Git is <code>~/.gitconfig</code>. If you&#39;ve ever set a parameter like <code>git config user.name &quot;Foo Bar&quot;</code>: this is where it ended up.</p>

<p>One awesome feature of the .gitconfig file is that you can <strong>conditionally include other config files</strong>, and this is what does the trick. Here&#39;s my <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file:</p>

<p><code></code>`ini
[user]
    name = Garrit Franke
    email = garrit@slashdev.space</p>

<p>[includeIf &quot;gitdir:~/work/&quot;]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-work</p>

<p>[includeIf &quot;gitdir:~/work/client2/&quot;]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-client2</p>

<p>[includeIf &quot;gitdir:~/sources/&quot;]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal</p>

<h1>...</h1>

<p><code></code>`</p>

<p>By default, my name and email are always set to my personal identity. I also store some other global settings here, but those are not relevant for this post. If the repository is located inside the <code>~/work</code> directory, a file named <code>~/.gitconfig-work</code> is included. This is just another gitconfig file. This is what that looks like in my case:</p>

<p><code></code>`ini
[user]
    name = Garrit Franke
    signingkey = 12345678
    email = garrit@work.de</p>

<p>[commit]
    gpgsign = true
<code></code>`</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;ll see where this is going. For every identity, you keep a separate gitconfig file and include it in the main <code>~/.gitconfig</code>. Crucially, this requires you to organize your repositories grouped by client.</p>

<p>This trick has simplified my project onboarding quite a bit. No more &quot;You forgot to update your Email Address&quot; requests from clients!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Thanks to <a href="https://jacksonchen666.com/">Jacksons</a> <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/darktheme.club/pull/79">update to darktheme.club</a>, I just came across a neat little <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme">CSS property</a> that turns a mostly CSS-free document into a pleasantly dark site:</p>

<p><code>css
:root {
  color-scheme: light dark;
}
</code></p>

<p>This will adjust all elements on the page to the color scheme preferred by the user - without any other custom styles! 🤯 It is also <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_color-scheme">widely supported</a> by browsers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been quite dependent on CSS-frameworks for any project I&#39;m starting. Going forward, I&#39;d be interested to see how framework-less sites would feel using this property. If all else fails, there&#39;s always the awesome <a href="https://simplecss.org/">simple.css</a> library, which you can slap on top of a raw document to make it pretty (and dark, if preferred) without using custom classes.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Just a quick tip that I thought is worth sharing. Instead of declaring:</p>

<p><code>css
.foo { 
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
}
</code></p>

<p>you can just use:</p>

<p><code>css
.foo {
  inset: 0;
}
</code></p>

<p>It&#39;s supported everywhere computers are sold!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>My grandpa has been using his current computer for about 10 years now. After
such a long time, the system has become quite slow and bulky. Back then it was
relatively normal to use a HDD as a primary hard drive, which adds to the slow
experience. It was time for an upgrade!</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Use <a href="https://clonezilla.org/">Clonezilla</a> on a live usb stick to
create an exact copy of your old drive onto your new one.</p></blockquote>

<p>I got him a 512 GB SSD, which, conveniently, is the same size of his current
HDD. While installing the new drive alongside his existing one, I thought about
how to copy the existing Windows-installation.</p>

<p>Naïvely, I thought that I could just <code>dd</code> the contents of the HDD onto the new
drive would work, since, <em>every byte is copied as is</em>, or at least that&#39;s what I
thought. Turns out it wasn&#39;t that easy. I&#39;m sure it would&#39;ve worked if I was
more careful, but by default, <code>dd</code> just wipes over each byte, not caring if it
made a mistake. After very long 5 hours, I came back to the PC to see that it
finished copying the 512 GB (yes, it&#39;s not just copying the data, it&#39;s copying
the entire partition!). In a super excited mood, I restarted the PC and selected
the SSD as a boot medium. Aaaaand... nothing. Windows tried to repair some stuff
but it wasn&#39;t successful. I fiddled around with the boot partition a bit, but I
had to give up after an hour or so.</p>

<h2>The second attempt</h2>

<p>After researching a bit (I should&#39;ve done that sooner...) I stumbled across
<a href="https://clonezilla.org/">Clonezilla</a>, a Linux distribution custom-built for
this purpose. I flashed it onto a usb-stick and started the cloning process.
After just 20 minutes (!), it was done cloning the existing data. The process is
extremely simple!</p>

<p>Before rebooting, I disconnected the old drive to make sure that there&#39;s no
funny business going on. Apparently, Windows had to self-adjust UIDs of the
drives, but after a short &quot;Preparing Windows&quot; animation, the system started up
as expected. <strong>Success</strong>!!</p>

<p>The performance of the new hard drive is amazing, at least compared to the HDD
my grandpa had before. Plus, we can use the existing HDD to take full system
backups every now and then, using the same process.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Today I learned how to get the selected language of a browser.</p>

<p>It&#39;s super simple!</p>

<p><code>js
const userLang = navigator.language || navigator.userLanguage;
</code></p>

<h2>An interesting discovery</h2>

<p>Eventhough I&#39;m using a chromium-based browser, the user-agent and some other
fields of the <code>navigator</code> object imply that I&#39;m running Mozilla Netscape 5.0.
This is a relic of the past, where the user agent heavily influenced the look
and feel of a served website. Nowadays, all rendering engines work more or less
equally, but back then, browsers tried to be as good as the market leader, so
they disquised themselves as Netscape. This podcast episode goes into more
detail about how this developed (jump to minute 3 to listen to this topic):</p>
