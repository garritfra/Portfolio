                <![CDATA[<p>My blog just turned five years old! üéâ</p>

<p>To celebrate this unique occasion, I want to announce something I&#39;ve been secretly working on: I wrote a book!</p>

<p><img alt="The cover of Five Years of Blogging" src="/assets/five-years-of-blogging-cover-3d.png"/></p>

<p><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/garrit/e/233695"><em>Five Years of Blogging: Ideas, Opinions and Guides written 2019 to 2024</em></a> serves as a memoir for the first five years of this blog. It&#39;s a collection of not all, but my most valuable blog posts capturing my ideas, opinions and the lessons I learned. The book is quite messy, but that&#39;s by design. I want to preserve all posts in the state that they have originally been written in. Where necessary, you may find introductory paragraphs or footnotes to explain something in more detail, but the original posts have all been left untouched.</p>

<p>Getting a copy of this book is the best way to support my writing. You can either <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/garrit/extras">buy the book directly on Buy Me a Coffee</a>, or you can <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/garrit/membership">become a monthly supporter</a>, which grants you a free copy after signing up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m extremely grateful for the journey this blog has taken me on, and the people I met along the way. Who knows, maybe there will be a &quot;Ten Years of Blogging&quot; book in the future?</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>In his book <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">Outliers</a>, Malcolm Gladwell popularized the idea that it takes 10.000 hours of concentrated practice to master a skill.</p>

<p>According to my <a href="https://wakatime.com">WakaTime</a> stats, I spent 2.384 hours writing code in an editor (December 2023). If you&#39;re reading this post in the future, this is my current record:</p>

<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@811525e7-5cc5-4eef-9e29-3cece3a03847"><img alt="wakatime" src="https://wakatime.com/badge/user/811525e7-5cc5-4eef-9e29-3cece3a03847.svg"/></a></p>

<p>This time is the time actually spent writing code. It doesn&#39;t track the time reading or thinking about it, nor the time spent in editors without the WakaTime plugin. It&#39;s hard to say how much time I spent engulfed in code, but this number is a good indicator as to how far I&#39;ve come in my programming journey.</p>

<p>I believe we should never say that we&#39;ve &quot;mastered&quot; a craft, even after spending 10.000 hours practicing it. There are always so many things to learn, so many novel ideas to catch up with.</p>

<p>So far, each of my 7 years of working as a software developer has advanced me tremendously. I&#39;m curious to see where I am once I reach 10.000 hours of practice.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I just finished the book <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary">Project Hail Mary</a> by Andy Weir. Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</p>

<p>I&#39;m completely nerdsniped. I was looking forward to each chapter, eagerly waiting for what will happen next. This book is full of completely unexpected turns, though I never felt lost. The plot is well thought out. Every chapter is like a puzzle piece that perfectly adds to the greater picture.</p>

<p>When I first heard about this book I was a bit skeptical. &quot;Human stranded in space&quot; surely can&#39;t fill some 500 pages (I&#39;m looking at you, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_(2013_film)">Gravity</a>). But having read <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel)#">The Martian</a> some time ago, I knew that Andy Weir&#39;s style of writing would catch me. And catch me he did. The way he describes complex topics completely resonates with me. No matter how unsolvable the problems of the protagonist seem, it&#39;s always an invitation to get your mind blown by the solution.</p>
