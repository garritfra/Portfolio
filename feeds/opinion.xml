                <![CDATA[<p>I&#39;m guilty of buying shiny new things. After being unhappy with the Bluetooth connectivity in the OnePlus Nord I bought in december of 2020, I bought a brand new Pixel 7 last december. I told myself that t would be using the OnePlus Nord for at least three years, preferably four, yet I gave in after two years due to some issue that could have been fixed with a pair of cable-headphones. I&#39;m now asking myself again: am I able to use my new Pixel 7 for more than 3 years?</p>

<p>I just stumbled upon a blog post called &quot;<a href="https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/my-long-goodbye-to-windows-xp">My long goodbye to Windows XP</a>&quot;, in which the author explains that he is currently replacing his 2008 laptop running Windows XP with a &quot;new&quot; PC running Windows 7. He states that he knew the ins and outs of this operating system, so why switch to a new one? Eventually he did switch, but to an OS that is already end of life.</p>

<p>I totally love this. If you&#39;re happy with what you got, you shouldn&#39;t let a new feature dictate how to change your workflow. Does one really need the features introduced in some software/hardware/tool in the past year? Wouldn&#39;t it make sense to use the things that have been battle-tested for at least a few years?</p>

<p>As I said, I&#39;m very guilty of living at the cutting edge of technology. Maybe it&#39;s time to slow down. I&#39;m certain it would simplify a lot of things.</p>

                Quality vs. Quantity

                <![CDATA[<p>The amount and quality of the posts on this blog strongly depends on my mood. Some times I want to write about every thought that crosses my mind, leading to 4+ average- to low-quality posts a week. I think I&#39;m in one of these phases right now.</p>

<p>Some other times, I feel like most of my thoughts are not worth the effort to write about, but the ones that I <strong>do</strong> write about, often become the ones that I&#39;m <a href="/posts/2021-04-07-pgp-guide">most</a> <a href="/posts/2021-10-04-server-side-caching-with-apollo-graphql">proud</a> <a href="/posts/2021-01-18-reasons-the-fediverse-is-better">of</a>.</p>

<p>These phases act like opposing forces that coexist very well. Pumping out more thoughts of lesser quality frees up my mind for higher quality ones, and when I&#39;m writing about higher quality thoughts, I get the urge to write more often, completing the circuit.</p>

<p>In the end, it&#39;s not about <strong>what</strong> you write about, but about the process of writing itself. Every post on a personal blog is <a href="https://kevquirk.com/thoughts-on-editing-posts/">a snapshot of your thoughts at a point in time</a>, no matter if you&#39;re feeling qualitative or quantitative.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Rust is not just a programming language, it&#39;s also a status symbol. By now, it kind of became a meme that people writing programs in Rust have to make explicit that &quot;X is written in Rust&quot;.</p>

<p>How fast or safe the language is doesn&#39;t define how good the software is. Software in TypeScript can be just as good as software written in C, if written by the right people.</p>

<p>When starting a new project, try to focus on the domain of the problem and pick a language based on that. Don&#39;t decide on the language before you know what problem you&#39;re trying to solve. If the answer to this is always one option (like Rust), <a href="https://seths.blog/2023/03/the-answer-to-every-question/">you might be in a bubble</a>.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I have a YubiKey that I use for work, and I love using it. But I won&#39;t get one for my personal life.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this for some time now, but I ultimately don&#39;t think the benefits outweigh the hassle of always carrying around another device that I risk losing or breaking.</p>

<p>A Yubikey provides a very good second factor, but so does my phone. My phone, just like a Yubikey, is locked behind a third factor (a pin or biometric sensor), so my phone essentially <em>is</em> a Yubikey. You can argue that the authenticator app on my phone (bitwarden) can be hacked, but I&#39;m willing to take that risk if it means I have to reset all security measures on all accounts if I lose the key.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m not getting a Yubikey.</p>
