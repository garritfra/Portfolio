                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This is a reply to Tony Mottaz&#39; <a href="https://www.tonymottaz.com/code-for-computers-and-humans/">blog post</a> about code that&#39;s easy to understand for humans.</p></blockquote>

<p>The understandability of a piece of code can be measured by how much time one needs to grasp its behavior. Less cognitive load usually means easier, and therefore faster, to understand.</p>

<p>Tony argues that the verbose version of the code (<code>isNaN(defaultValue) ? NaN : defaultValue;</code>) is better than the optimized version (<code>defaultValue;</code>) because it proves that the author has thought of the possible sideeffect.</p>

<p>However, I personally think this is in fact bad code. Although the code is <strong>trying</strong> to make obvious what it&#39;s doing, Tony had to pause and think about why it&#39;s written this way. This probably interrupted their flow of work, which is highly undesired. A short comment should have the same effect while keeping the reader in their flow. This is a perfect example for the &quot;<a href="https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/code-comments-why-not-how/">comment the why, now the how</a>&quot; mantra.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed Tony&#39;s post. It does a great job emphasizing that we should be curious about the code we read and write.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Planning our week, checking the time, suming up two numbers, reading a book. Often, digital devices are our default answer to a problem at hand. We&#39;ve become so used to being around a computer that we neglect that certain tasks could also be accomplished without it.</p>

<p>Often, we just need to <a href="/posts/2023-06-25-make-a-list">make a list</a>. Many of us have 10 todo-apps on our phone, each with its own bells and whistles. But do we really need those reminder notifications, tags, and priority levels? Most commonly, a pen and paper are all we need to remember what&#39;s on todays agenda.</p>

<p>The next time you&#39;re faced with a foreign problem, try asking yourself if whatever you&#39;re doing is worth the complexity of the solution. Often, though of course not always, the analog solution is most efficient.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Maybe this is just wishful thinking from someone who grew up in front of a physical keyboard, but I sometimes wish that my phone had a global &quot;undo&quot; button.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a reason why phones have evolved away from having such a feature, but sometimes, especially when editing text, it would be very useful to &quot;just hit ctrl-z&quot;, or whatever it would be on a phone. Some apps do have such a button, but they explicitly had to place it there and craft a feature around it.</p>

<p>I can imagine that Android and other OSes are capable of exposing an &quot;undo&quot; API that apps can implement to make this easier. A gesture well known to the user, similar to the &quot;back&quot; button or gesture on Android, would trigger an undo. For text, apps probably won&#39;t even have to implement anything. The Textbox element of the UI framework should be capable of undoing changes. For anything more complex, the app decides what to do with this action.</p>

<p>Again, probably just wishful thinking, but I really want my undos back!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I&#39;m guilty of buying shiny new things. After being unhappy with the Bluetooth connectivity in the OnePlus Nord I bought in december of 2020, I bought a brand new Pixel 7 last december. I told myself that t would be using the OnePlus Nord for at least three years, preferably four, yet I gave in after two years due to some issue that could have been fixed with a pair of cable-headphones. I&#39;m now asking myself again: am I able to use my new Pixel 7 for more than 3 years?</p>

<p>I just stumbled upon a blog post called &quot;<a href="https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/my-long-goodbye-to-windows-xp">My long goodbye to Windows XP</a>&quot;, in which the author explains that he is currently replacing his 2008 laptop running Windows XP with a &quot;new&quot; PC running Windows 7. He states that he knew the ins and outs of this operating system, so why switch to a new one? Eventually he did switch, but to an OS that is already end of life.</p>

<p>I totally love this. If you&#39;re happy with what you got, you shouldn&#39;t let a new feature dictate how to change your workflow. Does one really need the features introduced in some software/hardware/tool in the past year? Wouldn&#39;t it make sense to use the things that have been battle-tested for at least a few years?</p>

<p>As I said, I&#39;m very guilty of living at the cutting edge of technology. Maybe it&#39;s time to slow down. I&#39;m certain it would simplify a lot of things.</p>

                Quality vs. Quantity

                <![CDATA[<p>The amount and quality of the posts on this blog strongly depends on my mood. Some times I want to write about every thought that crosses my mind, leading to 4+ average- to low-quality posts a week. I think I&#39;m in one of these phases right now.</p>

<p>Some other times, I feel like most of my thoughts are not worth the effort to write about, but the ones that I <strong>do</strong> write about, often become the ones that I&#39;m <a href="/posts/2021-04-07-pgp-guide">most</a> <a href="/posts/2021-10-04-server-side-caching-with-apollo-graphql">proud</a> <a href="/posts/2021-01-18-reasons-the-fediverse-is-better">of</a>.</p>

<p>These phases act like opposing forces that coexist very well. Pumping out more thoughts of lesser quality frees up my mind for higher quality ones, and when I&#39;m writing about higher quality thoughts, I get the urge to write more often, completing the circuit.</p>

<p>In the end, it&#39;s not about <strong>what</strong> you write about, but about the process of writing itself. Every post on a personal blog is <a href="https://kevquirk.com/thoughts-on-editing-posts/">a snapshot of your thoughts at a point in time</a>, no matter if you&#39;re feeling qualitative or quantitative.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Rust is not just a programming language, it&#39;s also a status symbol. By now, it kind of became a meme that people writing programs in Rust have to make explicit that &quot;X is written in Rust&quot;.</p>

<p>How fast or safe the language is doesn&#39;t define how good the software is. Software in TypeScript can be just as good as software written in C, if written by the right people.</p>

<p>When starting a new project, try to focus on the domain of the problem and pick a language based on that. Don&#39;t decide on the language before you know what problem you&#39;re trying to solve. If the answer to this is always one option (like Rust), <a href="https://seths.blog/2023/03/the-answer-to-every-question/">you might be in a bubble</a>.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I have a YubiKey that I use for work, and I love using it. But I won&#39;t get one for my personal life.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this for some time now, but I ultimately don&#39;t think the benefits outweigh the hassle of always carrying around another device that I risk losing or breaking.</p>

<p>A Yubikey provides a very good second factor, but so does my phone. My phone, just like a Yubikey, is locked behind a third factor (a pin or biometric sensor), so my phone essentially <em>is</em> a Yubikey. You can argue that the authenticator app on my phone (bitwarden) can be hacked, but I&#39;m willing to take that risk if it means I have to reset all security measures on all accounts if I lose the key.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m not getting a Yubikey.</p>
