                <![CDATA[<p>The term &quot;DevOps&quot; can be interpreted in many different ways. It&#39;s often thrown around as a buzzword whenever somebody is talking about &quot;what comes after development&quot;. Obviously, it&#39;s not just that. Or is it? It depends on whom you&#39;re talking to.</p>

<p>Although I just recently started my new role as a &quot;DevOps Engineer&quot;, I&#39;m still discovering what that term means to me. I just had a fruitful conversation with the DevOps lead of a client, and they phrased this role in a very fitting way.</p>

<blockquote><p>A DevOps Engineer doesn&#39;t push the button, they enable the developers to push the button themselves.</p></blockquote>

<p>To me this role is fascinating, since it touches so many different aspects of software delivery.</p>
