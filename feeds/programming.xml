                <![CDATA[<p>I just added a simple search bar to my <a href="/links">&quot;More ...&quot;</a> page. It just redirects to a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> search with your search term and limits it to my site. Simple, yet effective!</p>

<p>The inspiration for this feature came from <a href="https://smeso.it/">Salvatore Mesoraca</a>&#39;s site. Here&#39;s the snippet, feel free to steal it:</p>

<p><code>jsx
&lt;form className=&quot;search&quot; method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input id=&quot;search&quot; type=&quot;search&quot; name=&quot;q&quot; placeholder=&quot;Search via DDG&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;sites&quot; value=&quot;garrit.xyz&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Search&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></p>

<h2>Try it out</h2>

<p>Try searching for anything!</p>

<p>&lt;form className=&quot;search&quot; method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input id=&quot;search&quot; type=&quot;search&quot; name=&quot;q&quot; placeholder=&quot;Search via DDG&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;sites&quot; value=&quot;garrit.xyz&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Search&quot; /&gt;

                <![CDATA[<p>Pandoc has <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#links">a feature</a> to covert links to footnotes. Unfortunately, this only applies to LaTeX documents. Since I want to stay away from LaTeX for reasons of bloat, I was looking for a more universal approach.</p>

<p>First, I encountered <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33900067/pandoc-filter-to-add-footnotes-to-links">this</a> thread suggesting to use a regular <a href="https://pandoc.org/filters.html">Pandoc filter</a>. This has one downside though: you need a Haskell toolchain on your system. So I moved on ... </p>

<p>I eventually stumbled across <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/discussions/9415">this</a> thread, explaining how to do the same thing but with a Lua filter instead of Haskell. Since Lua is embedded into Pandoc, you don&#39;t need to install anything. Hooray for embeddable languages!</p>

<p>Simply place the following snippet into file (<code>/filters/link-to-footnote.lua</code> for example):</p>

<p><code>lua
function Link(link)
    link.content:insert(pandoc.Note(link.target))
    return link.content
end
</code></p>

<blockquote><p><em>Note</em>: If you want to keep the original hyperlink in tact, replace the <code>return link.content</code> with <code>return link</code>.</p></blockquote>

<p>And add the following flag to your Pandoc build command:</p>

<p><code></code>`sh</p>

<h1>!/bin/sh</h1>

<p>pandoc text.md
    -o book.epub \
    --lua-filter=filters/link-to-footnote.lua \ # &lt;-- This one
    --metadata-file metadata.yaml \
    --standalone \
    # ...
<code></code>`</p>

<p>After compiling the document, you should now see that each link has a footnote with the link text.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>In his book <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">Outliers</a>, Malcolm Gladwell popularized the idea that it takes 10.000 hours of concentrated practice to master a skill.</p>

<p>According to my <a href="https://wakatime.com">WakaTime</a> stats, I spent 2.384 hours writing code in an editor (December 2023). If you&#39;re reading this post in the future, this is my current record:</p>

<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@811525e7-5cc5-4eef-9e29-3cece3a03847"><img alt="wakatime" src="https://wakatime.com/badge/user/811525e7-5cc5-4eef-9e29-3cece3a03847.svg"/></a></p>

<p>This time is the time actually spent writing code. It doesn&#39;t track the time reading or thinking about it, nor the time spent in editors without the WakaTime plugin. It&#39;s hard to say how much time I spent engulfed in code, but this number is a good indicator as to how far I&#39;ve come in my programming journey.</p>

<p>I believe we should never say that we&#39;ve &quot;mastered&quot; a craft, even after spending 10.000 hours practicing it. There are always so many things to learn, so many novel ideas to catch up with.</p>

<p>So far, each of my 7 years of working as a software developer has advanced me tremendously. I&#39;m curious to see where I am once I reach 10.000 hours of practice.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Docker builds images incrementally. Every line in a Dockerfile will generate a
new image that builds on top of the last one. This can be really handy if
something is not right in your build.</p>

<p>Since version 18.09 Docker has added a new backend for building images,
<a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit#buildkit">buildkit</a>. Unfortunately, buildkit
does not let you view the IDs of the intermediate containers it uses under the
hood. To work around that, you can opt out of buildkit by running a build with
buildkit disabled:</p>

<p><code>sh
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build --pull --rm -t myproject:latest .
</code></p>

<p>You should now see the IDs of the intermediate containers:</p>

<p><code>sh
Sending build context to Docker daemon  87.84MB
Step 1/16 : FROM node:16.15.1-alpine3.16 AS development
16.15.1-alpine3.16: Pulling from library/node
Digest: sha256:c785e617c8d7015190c0d41af52cc69be8a16e3d9eb7cb21f0bb58bcfca14d6b
Status: Image is up to date for node:16.15.1-alpine3.16
 ---&gt; e548f8c9983f
Step 2/16 : WORKDIR /usr/src/app
 ---&gt; Using cache
 ---&gt; 34e5c9bdb910
Step 3/16 : COPY package*.json ./
 ---&gt; Using cache
 ---&gt; 626e4ae998fc
Step 4/16 : RUN npm install glob rimraf
 ---&gt; Using cache
 ---&gt; 2d036b8354e0
Step 5/16 : RUN npm install
 ---&gt; Using cache
 ---&gt; 948709b4957f      &lt;-- HERE
Step 6/16 : COPY . .
...
</code></p>

<p>As mentioned, these IDs are valid docker images, so you can just launch them
and attach a shell like every other image:</p>

<p><code>sh
docker run -ti --rm 948709b4957f
</code></p>

<p>If you&#39;re not seeing a regular shell, but a Node.js REPL for example, this
might be because the <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> of that image was set to the binary of that
REPL. To work around that, you can override the entrypoint:</p>

<p><code>sh
docker run -ti --rm --entrypoint=/bin/sh 948709b4957f
</code></p>

<h2>When is this helpful?</h2>

<p>If your build fails at a particular step, you can attach a shell to the <strong>last
working</strong> step, inspect the filesystem, and execute the failing command manually.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I recently dove into a new project at work. We&#39;re starting from a blank page,
so of course this classic question came up:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;So should we use tabs or spaces for our formatting?&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>One of my teammates explained to us why the only logical answer to this is
&quot;Tabs&quot;, and you&#39;ll soon know why.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>Most formatters, by default, use either two or four spaces for indentation by
default. The <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> formatter does this, and it
somewhat became the norm for JavaScript projects. This has one huge downside
though: everyone on the team has to agree, or live with this standard.</p>

<p>Nowadays, almost all editors come with the ability to change the preferred
indentation settings, which will be overridden by the settings of the
formatter. I prefer an indentation of 4 spaces, which is reflected in all of my
code. If I&#39;m working on a project that uses an indentation of 2 spaces via
prettier, my preference will be overridden when formatting the code.</p>

<h2>Just use tabs</h2>

<p>The solution to this problem is simple: Create a <code>.editorconfig</code> file and set
the indentation style to tab, without a width:</p>

<p><code></code>`editorconfig
root = true</p>

<p>[*]
end<em>of</em>line = lf
charset = utf-8
indent_style = tab
<code></code>`</p>

<p>Almost all editors will be able to pick this file up and configure some
project-wide settings. If your editor is configured to use a indent width of 4,
this setting will be respected. If you&#39;re a maniac that indents their code with
8 spaces, you&#39;ll be pleased to see that you can finally use this style in your
code, without forcing anyone else to do as you do.</p>

<p>Even GitHub, GitLab and friends are able to respect this setting, giving
everyone the opportunity to view code in their preferred style.</p>

<p>I hope you now know why using a single tab of indentation makes the most sense if
you&#39;re working in a team. Let me know your thoughts!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Ever wondered how to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable?</p>

<p>I just found this very old note that I thought is worth sharing. The trick is
quite old and you might already know about this, but when I started out with
programming, it blew my mind.</p>

<p>In school, we get taught to use a temporary
variable to swap two numbers:</p>

<p><code></code>`js
let a = 5;
let b = 10;</p>

<p>let temp = a;</p>

<p>a = b; // a = 10
b = temp; // b = 5
<code></code>`</p>

<p>But by using some arithmetic, we can save us a few bytes of memory:</p>

<p><code></code>`js
let a = 5;
let b = 10;</p>

<p>a = a + b; // a = 15 ; b = 10
b = a - b; // a = 15 ; b = 5
a = a - b; // a = 10 ; b = 5
<code></code>`</p>

<p>Please <strong>never</strong> use this in any production code. The less we have to think
about a piece of code, the better it is. It&#39;s a fun thought experiment
nevertheless!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Here&#39;s a useful react hook for situations where you have to keep track of the
state of a dialog, popup, etc.:</p>

<p><code></code>`js
import { useState } from &quot;react&quot;;</p>

<p>export default (value) =&gt; {
	const [state, setState] = useState(value);</p>

<pre><code>const setStateActive = () =&gt; {
	setState(true);
};

const setStateInactive = () =&gt; {
	setState(false);
};

return [state, setStateActive, setStateInactive];</code></pre>

<p>};
<code></code>`</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p><code></code>`js
const SomeComponent = () =&gt; {
	const [isDeleteDialogOpen, openDeleteDialog, closeDeleteDialog] =
		useToggle(false);</p>

<pre><code>return (
	&lt;&gt;
		&lt;Button onClick={openDeleteDialog}&gt;Open Delete Dialog&lt;/Button&gt;
		&lt;Dialog isOpen={isDeleteDialogOpen} onClose={closeDeleteDialog}&gt;&lt;/Dialog&gt;
	&lt;/&gt;
);</code></pre>

<p>};
<code></code>`</p>
