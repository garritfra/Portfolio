                <![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve been using MacOS for years, and I was always happy with it. However, it
has some really annoying problems that don&#39;t seem to get attention by Apple.
This is a list of things that personally bother me. I will try to update it
whenever I encounter new issues.</p>

<ul><li>~~When plugging in a external monitor, some native Windows can&#39;t be used with a
mouse anymore. Restart required to fix.~~ (This seems to be fixed)</li><li>Dash-to-dock sometimes doesn&#39;t work for fullscreen-applications.</li><li>When opening a fullscreen window from the workspace-overview, the dock
sometimes stays visible. Has to be manually hovered to hide.</li><li>When using a chromium-based browser on an external monitor in
fullscreen-mode, the menu-bar sometimes doesn&#39;t appear when hovered.</li><li>When switching from the internal to an external monitor, the workspace
alignment is not how I left it.</li></ul>
