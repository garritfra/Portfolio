                <![CDATA[<p>The lottery is often used as a comparison for something that&#39;s far out of reach. But how far out of reach exactly is the lottery?</p>

<h2>1 in 302 Million</h2>

<p>Apparently, you have a 1 in 302 million chance to win the lottery. Well, that sounds like a lot... but how much is that exactly?</p>

<p>Imagine 66 bathtubs.</p>

<p>Now, imagine each of these bathtubs is filled to the brim with <strong>rice</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the grains of rice inside one of the bathtubs is painted gold. This is our jackpot.</p>

<p>Whenever you purchase a lottery ticket, imagine grabbing one grain of rice from this sea of bath tubs. Do you think you&#39;d have a chance to find the golden grain?</p>
