                <![CDATA[<p>The amount and quality of the posts on this blog strongly depends on my mood. Some times I want to write about every thought that crosses my mind, leading to 4+ average- to low-quality posts a week. I think I&#39;m in one of these phases right now.</p>

<p>Some other times, I feel like most of my thoughts are not worth the effort to write about, but the ones that I <strong>do</strong> write about, often become the ones that I&#39;m <a href="/posts/2021-04-07-pgp-guide">most</a> <a href="/posts/2021-10-04-server-side-caching-with-apollo-graphql">proud</a> <a href="/posts/2021-01-18-reasons-the-fediverse-is-better">of</a>.</p>

<p>These phases act like opposing forces that coexist very well. Pumping out more thoughts of lesser quality frees up my mind for higher quality ones, and when I&#39;m writing about higher quality thoughts, I get the urge to write more often, completing the circuit.</p>

<p>In the end, it&#39;s not about <strong>what</strong> you write about, but about the process of writing itself. Every post on a personal blog is <a href="https://kevquirk.com/thoughts-on-editing-posts/">a snapshot of your thoughts at a point in time</a>, no matter if you&#39;re feeling qualitative or quantitative.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Everywhere we look, we&#39;re bombarded with flashy symbols trying to grab our attention. This is even the case where we <strong>think</strong> that we&#39;re in control of what we&#39;re looking at. I made two simple changes that reduce visual distractions in my life.</p>

<h2>Android App Icons</h2>

<p>App icons play a serious role in how we interact with our phone. Over the years, there has been a constant battle for the most flashy icon on our home screen. But there&#39;s a cure: newer versions of Android <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/change-color-of-apps-on-android-phones-5213663">let you choose a color theme for apps that implement it</a>. It&#39;s by far not supported by every app out there, but in my case 90% of the app icons now have the same color. I feel way more comfortable looking at my phone, knowing that less things are trying to grab my attention right when I unlock my phone.</p>

<p>With this change, I found that I am more mindful about what app icon I tap on, since I was used to each icon having a different color. This makes it harder for my muscle memory to develop bad habits.</p>

<h2>RSS-Reader Favicons</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re using an RSS reader, chances are you&#39;re used to seeing a favicon next to the articles. I had the feeling that I was drawn more towards the favicon than the headline of the article, so I started looking for ways to disable favicons all together.</p>

<p>Miniflux provides a way to override the stylesheet of the feed in the settings. Simply append the following code-snippet and the favicons will be history:</p>

<p><code>css
.item-title img, .entry-website img {
  display: none;
}
</code></p>

<p>Of course every reader is different, so you might want to look into the documentation of your reader of choice.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>These changes might seem insignificant, but I found that they made a huge difference in how I interact with my phone. The suggestions above might not apply to your life, but I&#39;d like to encourage you to keep an eye out for unnecessary visual distraction in your life. Try to avoid it as much as possible.</p>
