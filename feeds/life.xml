<p>Whenever you&#39;re feeling stuck or you don&#39;t know what to do, make a list. The next step will often become clear.</p>

<p>Whether you&#39;re going shopping or you&#39;re feeling mentally overloaded. It helps to write down your thoughts in an actionable form. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s in some fancy mobile app or on a napkin. Just make a list.</p>

<p>Lists are the answer to almost anything. And where they&#39;re not, a spreadsheet is.</p>

                Optimizing work batch size

                <![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve been playing 
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)">Carcassonne</a> a lot with my girlfriend recently. It&#39;s a boardgame about building cities, roads and farms, and each completed &quot;project&quot; earns you some amount of points. The twist is that there&#39;s only a limited number of tiles, and once all tiles are used, the game is over unfinished projects are discarded.</p>

<p>The first couple of playthroughs I tried to maximize my score by increasing the number of projects I actively had going. I&#39;d start a new city or road whenever I could, thinking that the multipliers you sometimes get would pay off in the end. Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>Where I&#39;m from, we have multiple sayings for this approach. &quot;Having too many irons in the fire&quot; or &quot;dancing on too many parties&quot;. I was too busy starting new projects instead of making actual progress.</p>

<p>A far better approach is to finish projects early, earning less points, but with a greater certainty that they will pay off. With every project you start, the likelyhood of the other projects paying off decreases.</p>

<p>Keeping batch sizes small was a key concept of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing">lean manufacturing movement</a> in the 1980s, and has since been adopted by the <a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps movement</a> for the IT industry. If you want to learn more about this topic, you should check out <a href="https://itrevolution.com/product/the-devops-handbook-second-edition/">The DevOps Handbook</a>. It goes well beyond the basics of making IT processes more productive and efficient.</p>

<p>After realizing that small batch sizes are the key to success, I haven&#39;t lost a game of Carcassonne since. I hope you&#39;re not reading this, honey.ðŸ¤­</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I&#39;m guilty of buying shiny new things. After being unhappy with the Bluetooth connectivity in the OnePlus Nord I bought in december of 2020, I bought a brand new Pixel 7 last december. I told myself that t would be using the OnePlus Nord for at least three years, preferably four, yet I gave in after two years due to some issue that could have been fixed with a pair of cable-headphones. I&#39;m now asking myself again: am I able to use my new Pixel 7 for more than 3 years?</p>

<p>I just stumbled upon a blog post called &quot;<a href="https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/my-long-goodbye-to-windows-xp">My long goodbye to Windows XP</a>&quot;, in which the author explains that he is currently replacing his 2008 laptop running Windows XP with a &quot;new&quot; PC running Windows 7. He states that he knew the ins and outs of this operating system, so why switch to a new one? Eventually he did switch, but to an OS that is already end of life.</p>

<p>I totally love this. If you&#39;re happy with what you got, you shouldn&#39;t let a new feature dictate how to change your workflow. Does one really need the features introduced in some software/hardware/tool in the past year? Wouldn&#39;t it make sense to use the things that have been battle-tested for at least a few years?</p>

<p>As I said, I&#39;m very guilty of living at the cutting edge of technology. Maybe it&#39;s time to slow down. I&#39;m certain it would simplify a lot of things.</p>

                Quality vs. Quantity

                <![CDATA[<p>The amount and quality of the posts on this blog strongly depends on my mood. Some times I want to write about every thought that crosses my mind, leading to 4+ average- to low-quality posts a week. I think I&#39;m in one of these phases right now.</p>

<p>Some other times, I feel like most of my thoughts are not worth the effort to write about, but the ones that I <strong>do</strong> write about, often become the ones that I&#39;m <a href="/posts/2021-04-07-pgp-guide">most</a> <a href="/posts/2021-10-04-server-side-caching-with-apollo-graphql">proud</a> <a href="/posts/2021-01-18-reasons-the-fediverse-is-better">of</a>.</p>

<p>These phases act like opposing forces that coexist very well. Pumping out more thoughts of lesser quality frees up my mind for higher quality ones, and when I&#39;m writing about higher quality thoughts, I get the urge to write more often, completing the circuit.</p>

<p>In the end, it&#39;s not about <strong>what</strong> you write about, but about the process of writing itself. Every post on a personal blog is <a href="https://kevquirk.com/thoughts-on-editing-posts/">a snapshot of your thoughts at a point in time</a>, no matter if you&#39;re feeling qualitative or quantitative.</p>

                Visual Distractions

                <![CDATA[<p>Everywhere we look, we&#39;re bombarded with flashy symbols trying to grab our attention. This is even the case where we <strong>think</strong> that we&#39;re in control of what we&#39;re looking at. I made two simple changes that reduce visual distractions in my life.</p>

<h2>Android App Icons</h2>

<p>App icons play a serious role in how we interact with our phone. Over the years, there has been a constant battle for the most flashy icon on our home screen. But there&#39;s a cure: newer versions of Android <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/change-color-of-apps-on-android-phones-5213663">let you choose a color theme for apps that implement it</a>. It&#39;s by far not supported by every app out there, but in my case 90% of the app icons now have the same color. I feel way more comfortable looking at my phone, knowing that less things are trying to grab my attention right when I unlock my phone.</p>

<p>With this change, I found that I am more mindful about what app icon I tap on, since I was used to each icon having a different color. This makes it harder for my muscle memory to develop bad habits.</p>

<h2>RSS-Reader Favicons</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re using an RSS reader, chances are you&#39;re used to seeing a favicon next to the articles. I had the feeling that I was drawn more towards the favicon than the headline of the article, so I started looking for ways to disable favicons all together.</p>

<p>Miniflux provides a way to override the stylesheet of the feed in the settings. Simply append the following code-snippet and the favicons will be history:</p>

<p><code>css
.item-title img, .entry-website img {
  display: none;
}
</code></p>

<p>Of course every reader is different, so you might want to look into the documentation of your reader of choice.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>These changes might seem insignificant, but I found that they made a huge difference in how I interact with my phone. The suggestions above might not apply to your life, but I&#39;d like to encourage you to keep an eye out for unnecessary visual distraction in your life. Try to avoid it as much as possible.</p>
