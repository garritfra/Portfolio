                <![CDATA[<p>The term &quot;AI Slop&quot; is currently on the rise. It describes all the AI generated images and texts we see on the internet. I&#39;d like to propose a term that basically describes the opposite of AI Slop: <strong>Mental AI Fog</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead of <em>consuming</em> too much AI generated content (which also applies), AI Fog describes the inability to <em>produce</em> content without the help of AI. We&#39;re surrounded by flowery written articles and resources that we think that it&#39;s not worth it to put in the effort to write a text ourselves. This is comparable to how computer keyboards, spellchecking and autocorrection have rendered my generation and the ones to come incapable of comfortably writing longform text.</p>

<p>I&#39;m currently strongly suffering from AI fog. I&#39;m so used to letting some LLM flesh out a quick and dirty prompt nowadays that it&#39;s hard for me to write this text, get the point across and not feel insecure about my style of writing. This site is supposed to be a way to persist my thoughts whenever I want to, but are they still <em>my</em> thoughts if they have been proofread and corrected by a computer?</p>

<p>As a result, all these thoughts are piling up in my head. Where I previously braindumped thoughts on a piece of paper, I now only come up with a couple of words and let the AI elaborate. <strong>I&#39;m consuming what are supposed to be my own thoughts</strong>, which perpetuates the cycle.</p>

<p>This needs to stop. I need to get back <strong>creating</strong> things myself. I decided to abandon the use of LLMs for most content on this site. And where AI has been used, it will be clearly mentioned. I&#39;m contemplating adding some sort of &quot;Backed by AI&quot; label for certain pages to make it harder for myself to fall back to a helping hand. I will likely still be using LLMs, but making it obvious will force me to mindfully choose where it will be used.</p>

<p>Is this something you can relate to? Is AI fog even a fitting term for this? I don&#39;t know. And if it isn&#39;t, that&#39;s okay because I came up with it myself.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>About two weeks ago, I got myself my very first G-Shock. My entry ticket to the <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/CasioCult">#CasioCult</a>! Since I didn&#39;t want to miss out on any fitness features, I went with the <a href="https://www.casio.com/de/watches/gshock/product.DW-H5600-1/">G-Shock GW-H5600</a>, which comes with heart rate monitoring, step tracking and some other nice to have features.</p>

<p><img alt="A G-Shock DW-H5600" src="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/ab17acee-5997-4a3d-8536-c8c8243d72d2"/></p>

<p>Having read every review I could find, I knew that the watch had some quirks, but I ultimately loved the look of it. But two weeks later, I&#39;m forced to return the watch. Let me first go over what I liked and dislike about this watch.</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<p><strong>It&#39;s a G-Shock</strong></p>

<p>I love the look and feel of a G-Shock and other Casio watches. This is my first G-Shock, but I&#39;ve had an eye on this brand for quite some time. It&#39;s tough, sturdy, waterproof and probably also bullet proof.</p>

<p><strong>The display</strong></p>

<p>Oh, the display! It&#39;s gorgeous. Many people are complaining why this MIP display hasn&#39;t found its way to the rest of the G-Shock lineup. But I&#39;m sure they will retrofit other models soon.</p>

<p><strong>Proper paper manual</strong></p>

<p>My first impression after the unboxing was &quot;holy sheers, the manual is a <strong>book</strong>&quot;! And I mean that in the best way possible. Every little feature of the watch is explained in extreme detail in the manual. You rarely see this in other watches or gadgets these days.</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<p><strong>Questionable UI and UX decisions</strong></p>

<p>G-Shocks are known for user interfaces that &quot;just work&quot;. In this watch however, there are a few things that really make the watch frustrating to operate. Just to name a few quirks:</p>

<ul><li>There&#39;s only &quot;forward&quot;. If you scrolled passed something, you have to go aaaaall the way through the menu.</li><li>The timer can only be increased in 30 second steps. The UI is quite laggy, so setting a 10 minute timer takes about 1 minute of mashing buttons. There&#39;s also no press and hold.</li><li>The stopwatch only counts in seconds. No milliseconds.</li><li>You&#39;re locked to one task at a time. If you have a timer running, you can&#39;t go out of the menu. If you&#39;re recording a workout, you can&#39;t change the settings. And my favorite: You have to be on the home screen to sync settings from your phone to your watch. Just ... why?!</li><li>With a more or less recent update, the light now always turns on when you press any button. This makes the &quot;light&quot; button on the top right completely obsolete.</li><li>Unspecific battery indicator. You have four bars in the battery icon, that&#39;s it. The watch is solar powered, but it&#39;s to top up the battery at best. Don&#39;t expect to run fully off solar with this watch.</li></ul>

<p><strong>A bit thick</strong></p>

<p>Below the already thick bezel of the G-Shock sits the heart rate monitor, which is obnoxiously huge. I personally didn&#39;t feel like it irritated my skin, but it does add to the thickness.</p>

<p><strong>Fitness Features</strong></p>

<p>This is a two-edged sword. I originally wanted to list this as a pro. Features like run tracking, cardio status and sleep analysis are there, and they work fine. The step tracking and heart rate monitoring can be a bit off from time to time, but it&#39;s fine for the occasional run.</p>

<p>What&#39;s really bothering me is the mediocre implementation. There&#39;s no workout detection, the autopause feature barely works and you&#39;re limited to running, walking, gym workout and interval training. I also want to log my bike rides, which will always show up as a running activity in my app.</p>

<p>They recently added Strava integration, which sort of works. The data is all there, but for some reason the pace and moving time that Strava computes are completely off. For example, I ran 55 minutes straight with an average pace of 9 minutes / km. But with the data the watch sends, Strava thinks I only moved for 26 minutes with a pace of 4 minutes / km. If that were true, I could compete in the olympics! 😅</p>

<p><strong>Notifications barely work</strong></p>

<p>During the time I owned the watch, there was only one random day where the watch received notifications from my phone. I can&#39;t explain why, but I just didn&#39;t get this to work properly.</p>

<p><strong>Case is not screwed in. Could fall off</strong></p>

<p>This is just a minor thing if you really care about durability. All G-Shock squares so far had screwed in bezels. On this model, you can pull off the bezel with enough force. I&#39;ve never done it, but losing the bezel might be a concern.</p>

<h2>What&#39;s next?</h2>

<p>I enjoyed my time with this watch, but I filed a return. As pretty as the watch is, it is just too frustrating to use. Smart watches aren&#39;t a core part of Casio&#39;s business, and you can feel that in the lack of quality of the software. The app was likely developed as a one-off contract by some random agency, and once the contract ends, the watch won&#39;t ever be improved again.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve now ordered the <a href="https://www.garmin.com/de-DE/p/741462">Garmin Instinct 2S Solar</a>, which is very similar in terms of specs. MIP display, top-up solar charging, long-lasting battery and fitness features. But on top of that, it has features like music control, GPS, contactless payment and a compass. Contrary to Casio, Smartwatches are a core part of Garmin&#39;s business, which makes me believe that they go out of their way to develop the best possible watch they can. I will likely follow up with how this new watch compares to my G-Shock.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>I grew up in the countryside, where busses only came once an hour, but only until 7 PM. And on the weekend, you <strong>really</strong> had to plan ahead. Living without a car was almost unthinkable.</p>

<p><img alt="My car" src="/assets/posts/2024-05-08-i-sold-my-car/my-car.jpeg"/></p>

<p>After moving to the city in 2020, I found that I used my car less and less. My commute to work was easier with the bike (if I wasn&#39;t working from home), and for anything else, busses and trams were the way to go. The occasional family visit was the only excuse to use my car.</p>

<p>Owning a car doesn&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; expensive. Sure, gas is expensive, but simply owning one doesn&#39;t feel like a huge burden on your wallet. Just to get a rough estimate, I jotted down all running costs.</p>

<p><img alt="Running costs" src="/assets/posts/2024-05-08-i-sold-my-car/running-costs.jpeg"/></p>

<p>My car costs <strong>over 1000€ per year</strong>, or about 85€ per month, just to be moved about twice a month! So, a few weeks ago, I decided to sell it.</p>

<p>I created a posting on <a href="https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/">Kleinanzeigen</a> (a german descendant of - and previously owned by - eBay), and after about two weeks, the car had a new owner. I hope that it&#39;s in better hands now and lives on to be a happy and frequently used car.</p>

<p>Going forward, I&#39;m not worried about my mobility at all. My partner still owns her car and has the option to take the bus to work. So, if we&#39;re not on the road together, I can always fall back to using her car. And if she needs her car and I&#39;m desperate to go somewhere afar, there&#39;s also multiple ride-sharing options available in my town. They are a bit expensive to use, but spending 40€ for a day trip to my family every two months is still way less than paying 85€ a month for a car that&#39;s sitting there idle.</p>]]>

                Beating Elden Ring

                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>⚠️ WARNING ⚠️</strong>: This post contains a lot of spoilers for the game Elden Ring.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, I just beat Elden Ring. It took me 120 hours and, coincidentally, I was level 120 when I beat the final boss. That damn final boss... but more on that later.</p>

<p>Elden Ring won me over instantly, even though I&#39;ve never played any of the other Souls games. After beating <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, I called it my favorite game. I just needed more games like this. When Elden Ring came out, people compared The Lands Between to the open world of Hyrule, and I quickly agreed. The freedom these games give you is absolutely unbeaten. You almost never really get &quot;stuck&quot; on something. You can always wonder off and explore until you&#39;re ready to take on the fight.</p>

<p>After about 50 hours into playing Elden Ring, I kind of lost my focus and stopped playing for a while. It was too huge of a game to beat at the time, so I gave up.</p>

<p>But then, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Tears_of_the_Kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> came out and doubled up on the world of Hyrule. I absolutely adored this game. I spent day and night playing until I finally beat it. This game also motivated me to beat Elden Ring one more time. Despite failing over and over, each play session gave me a feeling of progression. I might not have beaten a boss yet, but there was always something happening the side that got me closer to beating it. Be it exploring and getting better gear or learning as much as I can about a boss to find ways to deal damange, I always got a small step closer to my goal. I&#39;d go as far as to say I never felt so determined to reach a goal ever before in my life.</p>

<p>The boss fights in Elden Ring are obviously extremely difficult, but they&#39;re always fair. The bosses in this game never make mistakes, you&#39;re the one that screwed up. You just keep failing and failing, but with each run, you learn something new about the fight that makes it easier in the next run. And when you finally overcoming this challenge gives you a feeling of accomplishment like nothing else could.</p>

<p>What I didn&#39;t realize in the beginning of my playthough is how extremely well rounded the world and the lore of this game is. I spent days and nights indulging myself in the lore through numerous YouTube videos, guides and Wikis. Only then did I begin to understand the scale of this game. Every action of each character, every building and every item fits in the grand scheme of the world.</p>

<p>Going out of this, the biggest thing that stuck with me is the determination. Failing is part of your life, and that is okay. No matter how daunting a task is, there&#39;s <strong>always</strong> a way to overcome it. The Elden Beast is the final boss of the game, and it&#39;s also where I spent about a quarter of my playtime. This thing has absurd attacks, immense health, and did I mention that you have to beat it after beating another extremely difficult boss, without being able to top up your health? This fight is ridiculous. I spent multiple weeks trying to beat it. I was really close to giving up, but as I mentioned earlier, each run gets you a tiny bit closer to the finish line, so I pushed through. I refined my build, I leveled up my stats and I learned how to dance with the beast. Eventually, I won the fight not by luck, but by determination. I now feel like I understand every attack well enough to dodge it. My mind was on autopilot when I beat it.</p>

<p>Knowing this much about a game didn&#39;t teach me any practical skills. There&#39;s nothing I can do now that I couldn&#39;t do before I knew that Rykard (Lord of Blasphemy), son of Rennala and Radagon (also known as Queen Marika), chose to go against the Erdtree and eventually fed himself to a serpent to devour the entire world (which you prevented). But there&#39;s something about this game that left me craving for more. It&#39;s truly a masterpiece.</p>

<h2>Bonus</h2>

<p>In case you&#39;re interested, I uploaded some of the bossfights during my playthrough in this YouTube playlist:</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>After cheating death himself, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus">Sisyphus</a> was punished to push a large boulder up a steep hill for eternity. Every time he reached the top, the boulder would roll back down and Sisyphus had to start over.</p>

<p>Our life is full of such toil. Mowing the lawn, cleaning the dishes and doing our taxes are examples of toil that prevents us from doing sustainable work. We should always seek to minimize toil where possible. We have dishwashers and spam filters to help us fight toil, but there are some reoccurring tasks that cannot be automated.</p>

<p>Sisyphus eventually found peace with his fate. Instead of seeing his punishment as an eternal burden, he saw it as his life&#39;s purpose. Maybe those comparatively small annoyances in our life are worth enjoying. They&#39;re part of what makes us human.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>So, after our <a href="/posts/2024-02-26-dive-log-phuket">adventures in Phuket</a>, we journeyed on to Nha Trang in Vietnam, where we also went diving.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the visibility was average, and the wildlife in Nha Trang wasn&#39;t as diverse as in Phuket, but that only made the hermit crabs or the occasional lionfish feel just that much more special.</p>

<p>In total, we did 4 dives in Nha Trang. Here&#39;s a full list, taken from my logbook:</p>

<p>| Title       | Date       | Site       | Depth (m) | Time (min) | Highlights                   |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Nha Trang 1 | 2024-02-25 | Dam Bay    | 12        | 45         | Cold water and sandy bottom  |
| Nha Trang 2 | 2024-02-25 | Mot Island | 13.5      | 45         | Squids and lots of anemones  |
| Nha Trang 3 | 2024-02-26 | Tam Island | 11.2      | 37         | Playing around with bouyancy |
| Nha Trang 4 | 2024-02-26 | Tam Island | 10        | 46         | Hermit crabs                 |</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>I just became a certified diver! 🥳</p>

<p>I got my license through the <a href="https://rumblefishadventure.com/">Rumblefish Adventure</a> divecenter in Kata Beach, as per a recommendation from a friend who happened to be around in the area when we were there.</p>

<p>Kata Beach is a great dive spot. It has crazy wildlife, it&#39;s just a short swim away from the beach and the visibility is quite good if you haven&#39;t seen many reefs yet (like myself).</p>

<p>After doing our PADI Open Water license, we went to Phi Phi Islands to do a fun dive. The experience swimming through the reefs there can simply not be put into words.</p>

<p>In total, we did 7 dives in Thailand. Here&#39;s a full list, taken from my logbook:</p>

<p>After Phuket, we went to Vietnam where we&#39;re currently also on a lot of fun diving trips. But I&#39;ll save that for another dive log post.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>I just read <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38829907">this comment</a> on a thread on HackerNews which resonated with me:</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#39;m trying to read less temporal (things that matter now) and more fundamental (stuff that mattered 1+ year ago and will still matter in 1+ year, with even wider intervals for non-tech content).
This does result in missing ~important things occasionally (e.g. I still don&#39;t know what happened with SamA at OpenAI, and yes, I am curious), but that&#39;s a small price to pay for greater intellectual sanctity and an increased attention budget to distribute across important tasks or funnel into something hyper focussed.</p></blockquote>

<p>Is this news important <em>now</em> or do I benefit from it in the long term? Our time is the most precious resource we have, and we should be careful how we spend it.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>That&#39;s a wrap! 2023 was an exciting year for me. I started my new role as a <a href="/posts/2023-04-22-the-role-of-a-devops-engineer">DevOps Engineer</a> at my current company, I got <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/open-source-der-patch-basierte-git-workflow-soll-bleiben-2302-171585.html">two</a> <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/wertestrom-in-devops-das-projekt-am-laufen-halten-2312-180174.html">articles</a> published on a prominent German news site and finally finished my <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100DaysToOffload</a> challenge!</p>

<p>This year, I launched two projects: <a href="https://sendpasswords.net/">sendpasswords.net</a> and <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/positive_hackernews">Positive Hacker News</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="/posts/2023-01-02-welcome-2023">last year&#39;s review</a>, I said I wanted to launch <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/fling">Fling</a>, my household management app. Fling is currently in open alpha, so you can try it out <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.garritfra.fling">on Android</a> or via the <a href="https://fling-list.web.app">hosted website</a> to give feedback! I&#39;m planning a public release very soon.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I wanted to launch <a href="https://docs.kubinity.com/">Kubinity</a>. This was a very ambitious project, and although it technically works, it&#39;s very hard to maintain due to high running costs, which I&#39;m not ready to pay yet.</p>

<p>I have some more drafts for projects in private repositories. One project that I&#39;m feeling comfortable to release next year is a website for the #10ShittyProjects (working title) hashtag. More on that hopefully later!</p>

<h2>Goals for 2024</h2>

<p>Here are some personal goals that I want to set myself for the upcoming year. Some of them are already defined on my <a href="/impossible">impossible list</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Build a side project that generated at least 100€ of value</li><li>Get a scuba diving license</li><li>Do a 10 km run (I really need to start moving again)</li><li>Sell my car</li><li>Write at least 50 blog posts</li></ul>

<h2>Prediction results</h2>

<p><strong>&quot;Meta will change course (again), and kill the &quot;Metaverse&quot;&quot;</strong></p>

<p>A <a href="https://labs.sogeti.com/the-metaverse-is-dead/#:~:text=The%20Real%20Promise%20of%20VR%2FAR%20Lies%20in%20Training%20Simulations&amp;text=Yet%2C%20as%20of%202023%2C%20we,Reality%20(AR)%20has%20diminished.">quick Google search</a> reveals that the metaverse as originally imagined is not dead, but it&#39;s focus shifted to a more enterprise-y approach. I must admit that this prediction was quite vague. Depending on whom you ask, the metaverse is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">both alive and dead at the same time</a>.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Cheap matter devices will enter the market. As a reference point: I predict that there will be a matter-ready smart plug for under 20€ on Amazon&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I found <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/iA9ZBQf">this</a> matter-enabled smart plug on Amazon for 19,54€. If this is a real product, I&#39;d say my prediction is a pass!</p>

<p><strong>&quot;AI generated content will be regulated in some way&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Also a pass! On December 9th, the European union agreed on the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">EU AI Act</a> and will now become EU law.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Twitter is still around, but it&#39;s still not profitable&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Twitter is in fact <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/twitter-statistics/#:~:text=Twitter%20generated%20%244.4%20billion%20revenue%20in%202022%2C%20a%2011%25%20decrease,a%20loss%20of%20advertising%20revenue.">still not profitable</a>. I&#39;ll leave the &quot;Twitter is still around&quot; part up for debate, as it&#39;s now called X.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;I still won&#39;t have finished my #100DaysToOffload challenge from 2021&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Wrong!! In early December, I decided to push through and whip out one post a day. I <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-12-23-100daystooffload-i-made-it">finished the challenge</a>!</p>

<h2>2024 Predictions</h2>

<ul><li>Bitcoin will at last reach a value of 100,000$, following the <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/countdown/btc-halving-2024-05-10-12-00">halving</a> likely happening in 2024</li><li>SpaceX will use a <a href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/">Starship</a> prototype to launch Starlink satellites into orbit</li><li>Tesla cars a still not fully self driving (<a href="https://motherfrunker.ca/fsd/">reference</a>)</li><li>Google will replace their main search with an AI chat bot (see <a href="https://bard.google.com">Bard</a>)</li></ul>

<p>Let&#39;s see what 2024 brings to the table!</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>For as long as I can remember, I often had the feeling of not being able to get a full breath. I&#39;m taking deep breaths and sometimes forcing a yawn to overcome this feeling, sometimes successful, sometimes failing and trying again. This feeling gets worse the more I focus on my breath.</p>

<p>I always felt like this is somewhat uncommon, since none of my friends and family can relate to this feeling, but it wasn&#39;t worse enough to justify consulting a doctor about it either.</p>

<p>Doing some research, it seems like this phenomenon is called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath">dyspnea</a>, or &quot;air hunger&quot;. Some guy even made <a href="https://airhunger.org/">a website</a> about it. In a nutshell, it is caused by your body not being able to regulate carbon levels in your blood, which leads to an urge to breath unnaturally.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XliOGg8Tl98">video</a>, the author points out that this might be caused by irregular breathing patterns. Indeed, I often find myself breathing through the mouth or sitting in awkward positions with a humpback when the symptoms are at its worst. In fact, what led me to look this up was because I was annoyed by the feeling while I&#39;m laying in bed staring down at my screen, which is a very unnatural position.</p>

<p>A simple trick to get into a more regular breathing pattern is apparently to force yourself to breathe through the nose. Mouth breathing lets your body take in way more air than you need, which throws off the balance of the carbon levels in your lungs.</p>

<p>It seems like nose breathing does work very well. Where I&#39;ve just been struggling with air hunger, once I forced myself to nose breathe, the urge to breathe doesn&#39;t come nearly as often anymore.</p>

<p>These are just my results after some quick research. The topic of short breathing seems to be quite broad. Perhaps you&#39;re struggling with this as well. In that case, I hope this post was helpful to you!</p>
