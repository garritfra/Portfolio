                <![CDATA[<p>Self-hosting software is not just rainbows and sunshine. I used to self-host a lot of my tools, but after some time the burden of maintaining those tools made me switch to hosted alternatives.</p>

<p>However, there are a few projects that I stuck with over the years, and which I think deserve a deep appreciation.</p>

<h2>Miniflux</h2>

<p><a href="https://miniflux.app/">Miniflux</a> is a very minimal, self-hostable RSS reader. It&#39;s been rock-solid since they day I started using it. The data for the application entirely lives In a Postgres database, which makes migrating the application to new infrastructure setups an absolute breeze. I&#39;ve been meaning to support the author for quite some time now, but the cost of maintaining an instance yourself is basically zero, so I&#39;ve yet to find the time to switch to their paid hosted instance.</p>

<h2>Plausible Analytics</h2>

<p><a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a> is another tool that just keeps on running. I haven&#39;t had any issues with it whatsoever, and I can&#39;t remember the last time I had to do a manual intervention. Just like Miniflux, there&#39;s a paid instance, which supports the author, and just like Miniflux, the software is so good that I haven&#39;t had a reason to switch to it yet. Oh, the irony.</p>

<h2>BirdsiteLIVE</h2>

<p>While my instance of <a href="https://birdsite.slashdev.space/">BirdsiteLIVE</a> is currently in a bad shape, this is not at all the fault of the software. There are limitations to the amount of Twitter API requests you can make, and I did a poor job managing the users on that instance. It&#39;s currently very overloaded and just very few tweets make it through. I will have to set aside some time to fix this, but the software itself has been rock solid since the day I started using it.</p>

<h2>Synapse (Matrix)</h2>

<p>I was hesitant to mention <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> on this list. I had my ups and downs with Synapse (their Python implementation of a Matrix server), but the fact that my instance is still running after multiple infrastructure transitions and even a migration from SQLite to Postgres says something about the quality of the software. I have a feeling that Synapse is fairly resource-hungry, but if you feed it with enough RAM and disk, it will keep running indefinitely.</p>

<h2>Homeassistant</h2>

<p>You can throw <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Homeassistant</a> on a Raspberry Pi and everything works out of the gate. I even migrated my instance from a RPi 3 to a RPi 4 via their backup and restore functionality. It&#39;s absolutely flawless.</p>

<h2>Dead projects</h2>

<p>I think it&#39;s fair to also mention the software that I no longer self-host.</p>

<h3>E-Mail</h3>

<p>Just don&#39;t roll your own email.</p>

<h3>Mastodon</h3>

<p>Too power hungry for my taste. No easy way to host inside docker, which made it a pain to keep running. I&#39;m very happy with <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">Fosstodon</a>, and don&#39;t see a reason to switch to a self-hosted instance any time soon.</p>

<h3>FreshRSS</h3>

<p>I tried replacing Miniflux once, but failed. Nothing beats Miniflux.</p>

<h3>Prometheus + Grafana</h3>

<p>Monitoring <strong><em>inside</em></strong> your infra works until the infra goes down, at which point you&#39;re essentially driving blindfolded. I switched to Grafana Cloud, which includes a very generous free tier.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I just finished migrating a postgres database to a new host. To remember how to
do it next time, I&#39;m writing down the commands I used here.</p>

<p>I usually just shut down the database and then copy the local directory where
the volume was mounted onto the new host. This time though, I seemed to be
getting some I/O errors, so I had to do it the &quot;right&quot; way.</p>

<p>To be fair, this note is based on
<a href="https://www.netguru.com/blog/how-to-dump-and-restore-postgresql-database">this</a>
guide. I modified it to fit my workflow with docker.</p>

<h2>Creating a dump</h2>

<p>Log into the old host:</p>

<p><code>
ssh &lt;user&gt;@host
</code></p>

<p>Connect to the postgres-container:</p>

<p><code>
docker exec -ti myservice_db_1 /bin/bash
</code></p>

<p>Create a dump. You can name your dump as you wish - I&#39;m using dates to
distinguish multiple dumps:</p>

<p><code>
pg_dump -U db_user db_name &gt; db_name_20220531.sql
</code></p>

<p>Copy the dump to the host machine:</p>

<p><code>
docker cp myservice_db_1:/db_name_20220531.sql ~/
</code></p>

<h2>Moving the dump to the new host</h2>

<p>The easiest way to get the dump off of the old server and onto the new one is to
use your local machine as a middleman.</p>

<p>First, download the dump to your machine:</p>

<p><code>
scp &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:~/db_name_20220531.sql .
</code></p>

<p>Then, do the same thing but reversed, with the new host:</p>

<p><code>
scp ./db_name_20220531.sql &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:~/
</code></p>

<h2>Restoring the dump</h2>

<p>First, connect to the new host:</p>

<p><code>
ssh &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Assuming the docker service is already running on the new host, attach to the
db-container, just like above:</p>

<p><code>
docker exec -ti myservice_db_1 /bin/bash
</code></p>

<p>This time, we have to do some fiddling on the database, so attach a session to
postgres using their cli:</p>

<p><code>
psql -U my_user
</code></p>

<p>Before &quot;resetting&quot; the existing DB to apply the dump, we have to connect to
another database. The <code>postgres</code> DB is always there, so you can use that.</p>

<p><code>
\c postgres
</code></p>

<p>Now, we drop the existing DB and re-add it:</p>

<p><code>sql
drop database database_name;
create database database_name with owner your_user_name;
</code></p>

<p>And now, the moment you&#39;ve been waiting for! Leave the psql-session and apply
the dump:</p>

<p><code>
psql -U db_user db_name &lt; db_name_20220531.sql
</code></p>

<p>That&#39;s all! You now have the exact copy of production database available on your
machine.</p>
