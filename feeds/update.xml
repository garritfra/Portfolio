                <![CDATA[<p>RSS is - in my humble opinion - one of the best ways to consume content today.
Its only downside is that it&#39;s quite difficult to find new interesting feeds.
If you&#39;re looking for inspiration, here&#39;s a list of the RSS-feeds I&#39;m subscribed
to as of August, 2022. Some of the entries may intersect with my
<a href="/blogroll">blogroll</a>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not keep this one-sided! If you&#39;re also using RSS and have a blog, why not
publish a list of <strong>your</strong> favorite feeds?</p>

<ul><li><strong>HackerNews</strong> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Pretty</a>, <a href="https://hnrss.org/frontpage">RSS</a>) - This one&#39;s obvious!</li><li><strong>Matt Rickard</strong> (<a href="https://matt-rickard.com/">Pretty</a>, <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/rss">RSS</a>) - Highly interesting posts about software and startups</li><li><strong>Drew DeVault</strong> (<a href="https://drewdevault.com">Pretty</a>, <a href="https://drewdevault.com/blog/index.xml">RSS</a>) - While Drew&#39;s opinions are highly controversial, I do think it&#39;s valuable to read his posts</li><li><strong>Wandering Thoughts</strong> (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Pretty</a>, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/?atom">RSS</a>) - Interesting articles about Linux, SystemD and DevOps</li><li><strong>Kev Quirk</strong> (<a href="https://kevq.uk">Pretty</a>, <a href="https://kevq.uk/feed/">RSS</a>) - Kev&#39;s posts are always a fun read!</li><li><strong>Seth Godin</strong> (<a href="https://seths.blog">Pretty</a>, <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/sethsblog">RSS</a>) - I don&#39;t actively follow this blog, but it occasionally gives me food for inspiration</li><li><strong>The New Oil</strong> (<a href="https://blog.thenewoil.org/">Pretty</a>, <a href="https://blog.thenewoil.org/feed/">RSS</a>) - Some occasional technology reviews</li><li><strong>Tiny Projects/Ben Stokes</strong> (<a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/">Pretty</a>, <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/feed.xml">RSS</a>) - Ben doesn&#39;t post as much as he used to, but his posts are full of great ideas!</li><li><strong>Tagesschau</strong> (<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de">Pretty</a>, <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/xml/rss2/">RSS</a>) - My source of german news</li><li><strong>t3n</strong> (<a href="https://t3n.de">Pretty</a>, <a href="https://t3n.de/rss.xml">RSS</a>) - Another german news source, focused around technology and NewWork topics. I thought about removing the description though, as the articles are somewhat poorly written. Still looking for alternatives!</li><li><strong>xkcd</strong> (<a href="https://xkcd.com/">Pretty</a>, <a href="https://xkcd.com/atom.xml">RSS</a>) - come on, did you really think I wasn&#39;t subscribed to Randall?</li></ul>

<p>Wrote a &quot;What&#39;s on my feed?&quot; entry yourself? Let me know, and I&#39;ll link it here!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s christmas season! I hope you and your family are safe and sound. My main focus this month is to expand my knowledge about compilers, by <a href="https://sr.ht/~garritfra/sabre/">building one from scratch</a>. It&#39;s a compiler for a very simple language, but it gets the job done. So far, you can write <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~garritfra/sabre/tree/master/examples">simple algorithms</a>, and compile them to JavaScript. A more sophisticated C backend is in development, but I still need a plan for expanding the target-specific builtin functions to provide more features in the standard library. An important topic at the moment is the <a href="https://garritfra.github.io/sabre/">documentation of the project</a>. Since the compiler itself has gotten relatively stable, all the language-features now need to be captured and written down. There is also a <a href="https://garritfra.github.io/sabre/developers/contributing.html">contributing guide</a>, if you want to help out, or want to get into compiler design.</p>

<p>Stay home and stay safe!</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>Hi, I wanted to share some things I&#39;m currently working on. Maybe I&#39;ll turn this into a monthly thing, who knows. :)</p>

<p>One major goal I set for myself in the upcoming months is to build a SaaS for freelancers. Some features of this will include handling clients, projects and expenses. A thing I&#39;m struggeling with right now it to find a lightweight way to host it. It is currently deployable through docker containers, but I am not 100% satisfied with my current setup. I will give some updates on this in the future. I aim to release a very early alpha version for free soon, so that some people can stress test it extensively. For now, you can of course self-host it. I really don&#39;t want to impose subscription fees for it&#39;s users, but I will see how it goes. You can find the source code for it <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/omega-crm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, I increasingly gained interested in the <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini project</a>. In a nutshell, this is a very minimal alternative to HTTP, with a strong emphasis on simplicity. The maintainers clearly embrace a DIY mindset, which I want to follow. I set myself the rule to only interact with gemini using tools I wrote myself. To achive this, I am currently writing <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~garritfra/taurus">my own Gemini server called &quot;Taurus&quot;</a> to eventually set up my own geminispace. I have not yet looked deeply into building a client, but I might do this once I&#39;m happy with my server. I admit that I&#39;m currently cheating a bit, by testing my server using a browser recommended by the gemini team ;)
If you are interested in this project, I highly recommend to check out the <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.html">gemini specification</a>, and play around with some geminispaces. Maybe you could set up a server for yourself?</p>]]>
