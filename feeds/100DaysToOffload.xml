                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This is a reply to Tony Mottaz&#39; <a href="https://www.tonymottaz.com/code-for-computers-and-humans/">blog post</a> about code that&#39;s easy to understand for humans.</p></blockquote>

<p>The understandability of a piece of code can be measured by how much time one needs to grasp its behavior.</p>

<p>Tony argues that the verbose version of the code (<code>isNaN(defaultValue) ? NaN : defaultValue;</code>) is better than the optimized version (<code>defaultValue;</code>) because it proves that the author has thought of the possible sideeffect.</p>

<p>However, I personally think this is in fact bad code. Although the code is <strong>trying</strong> to make obvious what it&#39;s doing, Tony had to pause and think about why it&#39;s written this way. This probably interrupted their flow of work, which is highly undesired. A short comment should have the same effect while keeping the reader in their flow. This is a perfect example for the &quot;<a href="https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/code-comments-why-not-how/">comment the why, now the how</a>&quot; mantra.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed Tony&#39;s post. It does a great job emphasizing that we should be curious about the code we read and write.</p>

                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: This post stirred up some interesting discussions on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38110286">HackerNews</a> and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/gnv9ho/tracking_sqlite_database_changes_git">Lobste.rs</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>SQLite stores data in binary. If you run <code>cat mydb.sqlite</code>, you&#39;ll see a bunch of gibberish that doesn&#39;t resemble structured data at all. If you want to track changes and updates to a database using Git, you won&#39;t be able to see full diffs by default. You&#39;ll see that the file has changed, but not what changed exactly:</p>

<p><code>diff
diff --git a/mydb.sqlite b/mydb.sqlite
index f412c72..8f49ea5 100644
Binary files a/mydb.sqlite and b/mydb.sqlite differ
</code></p>

<p>So, is there a way around that? Turns out: there is! Here&#39;s a diff between two states of the SQLite database of <a href="https://www.gnucash.org/index.phtml">GnuCash</a>, which I&#39;m currently trying out to manage my finances. I&#39;ll explain how I got this diff afterwards:</p>

<p>First, add a diff type called &quot;sqlite3&quot; to your config. The simplest way is to just run these commands:</p>

<p><code>shell
git config diff.sqlite3.binary true
git config diff.sqlite3.textconv &quot;echo .dump | sqlite3&quot;
</code></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can add this snippet to your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> or <code>.git/config</code> in your repository:</p>

<p><code>gitconfig
[diff &quot;sqlite3&quot;]
        binary = true
        textconv = &quot;echo .dump | sqlite3&quot;
</code></p>

<p>Next, create a file called <code>.gitattributes</code> if it&#39;s not already present and add this line:</p>

<p><code>gitattributes
*.sqlite diff=sqlite3
</code></p>

<blockquote><p>Note that the filename (<code>*.sqlite</code>) may differ from your setup. In my case for example, it should match files with <code>*.gnucash</code>.</p></blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s about it! The next time you run <code>git diff</code> or any other command that produces a diff on a sqlite file, you&#39;ll see a nicely formatted diff of the changes.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Here&#39;s a quick tip on how to manage multiple Git identities (e.g. personal, work, client1, client2).</p>

<p>I organize my Git repos in three levels. My personal projects live in a <code>~/sources</code> directory. All my work projects live in <code>~/work</code>. This is the first level.</p>

<p>Level 2 is the client, e.g. <code>~/work/client1</code>. Naturally, level 3 is the project repository: <code>~/work/client1/foo-api</code>.</p>

<p>This is how my work directory is organized:</p>

<p><code>
/Users/garrit/work
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ foo-api
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ foo-ios
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ foo-android
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ client2
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bar-ios
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bar-middleware
</code></p>

<p>Now, say that <code>client2</code> demands that we commit with a different identity than our default work email. Besides that, you probably also have a personal email address for your own projects. How do you manage that?</p>

<h2>.gitconfig includes</h2>

<p>The global configuration file for Git is <code>~/.gitconfig</code>. If you&#39;ve ever set a parameter like <code>git config user.name &quot;Foo Bar&quot;</code>: this is where it ended up.</p>

<p>One awesome feature of the .gitconfig file is that you can <strong>conditionally include other config files</strong>, and this is what does the trick. Here&#39;s my <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file:</p>

<p><code></code>`ini
[user]
    name = Garrit Franke
    email = garrit@slashdev.space</p>

<p>[includeIf &quot;gitdir:~/work/&quot;]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-work</p>

<p>[includeIf &quot;gitdir:~/work/client2/&quot;]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-client2</p>

<p>[includeIf &quot;gitdir:~/sources/&quot;]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal</p>

<h1>...</h1>

<p><code></code>`</p>

<p>By default, my name and email are always set to my personal identity. I also store some other global settings here, but those are not relevant for this post. If the repository is located inside the <code>~/work</code> directory, a file named <code>~/.gitconfig-work</code> is included. This is just another gitconfig file. This is what that looks like in my case:</p>

<p><code></code>`ini
[user]
    name = Garrit Franke
    signingkey = 12345678
    email = garrit@work.de</p>

<p>[commit]
    gpgsign = true
<code></code>`</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;ll see where this is going. For every identity, you keep a separate gitconfig file and include it in the main <code>~/.gitconfig</code>. Crucially, this requires you to organize your repositories grouped by client.</p>

<p>This trick has simplified my project onboarding quite a bit. No more &quot;You forgot to update your Email Address&quot; requests from clients!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Planning our week, checking the time, suming up two numbers, reading a book. Often, digital devices are our default answer to a problem at hand. We&#39;ve become so used to being around a computer that we neglect that certain tasks could also be accomplished without it.</p>

<p>Often, we just need to <a href="/posts/2023-06-25-make-a-list">make a list</a>. Many of us have 10 todo-apps on our phone, each with its own bells and whistles. But do we really need those reminder notifications, tags, and priority levels? Most commonly, a pen and paper are all we need to remember what&#39;s on todays agenda.</p>

<p>The next time you&#39;re faced with a foreign problem, try asking yourself if whatever you&#39;re doing is worth the complexity of the solution. Often, though of course not always, the analog solution is most efficient.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Today marks the completion of my second pocket notebook. You may view my <a href="/posts/2023-09-09-everyday-carry-notebooks">About My Pocket Notebook</a> post as part one of this series, since I wrote it near the end of my first notebook. I think it would be interesting to share my experience with this each notebook. One day I&#39;ll maybe have a nice history of posts that I can look back at. üôÇ</p>

<p>This notebook lasted from 2023-09-10 to 2023-10-09, roughly one month. Here&#39;s a picture of it, after living in my back pocket every single day:</p>

<p><img alt="Field Notes #2" src="/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_2.jpeg"/></p>

<h3>What&#39;s in it?</h3>

<p>I used this notebook as a todo list, a travel journal, quick sketches, braindumps, simple calculations and much more. It&#39;s become a place to dump thoughts whenever and wherever I want to. Sometimes, it&#39;s genuinely interesting facts, like how to find north when all you have is a clear night sky.</p>

<p><img alt="Notes on how to find north at night" src="/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_2_page_5.jpeg"/></p>

<p>And sometimes it&#39;s just a random collection of uninteresting thoughts that wouldn&#39;t leave my head.</p>

<p><img alt="Random collection of notes" src="/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_2_page_32.jpeg"/></p>

<p>Some of these notes may mature into a project or blog post, like <a href="/posts/2023-09-29-undo-on-mobile-phones">the second to last note on that page</a>, while others just fade into the abyss. But that&#39;s okay! The point is to get these thoughts out of my head to work with them more easily.</p>

<h3>What&#39;s next?</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll keep on writing! I got a bunch of new FIELD NOTES notebooks to fill up. Since my next notebook will likely live with me through the halloween season, I opted for the <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/harvest">Harvest</a> edition as my next notebook. üéÉ</p>

<p><img alt="Field Notes #3" src="/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_3.jpeg"/></p>

<p>I&#39;m curious to see where this one takes me.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I just finished the book <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary">Project Hail Mary</a> by Andy Weir. Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</p>

<p>I&#39;m completely nerdsniped. I was looking forward to each chapter, eagerly waiting for what will happen next. This book is full of completely unexpected turns, though I never felt lost. The plot is well thought out. Every chapter is like a puzzle piece that perfectly adds to the greater picture.</p>

<p>When I first heard about this book I was a bit skeptical. &quot;Human stranded in space&quot; surely can&#39;t fill some 500 pages (I&#39;m looking at you, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_(2013_film)">Gravity</a>). But having read <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel)#">The Martian</a> some time ago, I knew that Andy Weir&#39;s style of writing would catch me. And catch me he did. The way he describes complex topics completely resonates with me. No matter how unsolvable the problems of the protagonist seem, it&#39;s always an invitation to get your mind blown by the solution.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Close your eyes. Picture yourself standing at a ledge with a rope tied to another ledge that&#39;s 10 steps away. Now, step by step, slowly walk across this rope until you&#39;re at the other side.</p>

<p>I often use this experiment as an indication for how focused I am at a given moment. As easy as this sounds, I rarely make it to the other side. On some days, I can&#39;t even step on the rope before my mind gets distracted and I have to start over. On some other days, I may get a few steps before falling off. With enough practice however, I may get to the other side.</p>

<p>This technique also works very well for short meditation sessions. I close my eyes and try to get to the other side. Whenever I fall off, I try again until my mind is focused enough to walk the entire rope.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious: are you able to walk the entire rope, or are you also struggling to take control over this mindscape?</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Maybe this is just wishful thinking from someone who grew up in front of a physical keyboard, but I sometimes wish that my phone had a global &quot;undo&quot; button.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a reason why phones have evolved away from having such a feature, but sometimes, especially when editing text, it would be very useful to &quot;just hit ctrl-z&quot;, or whatever it would be on a phone. Some apps do have such a button, but they explicitly had to place it there and craft a feature around it.</p>

<p>I can imagine that Android and other OSes are capable of exposing an &quot;undo&quot; API that apps can implement to make this easier. A gesture well known to the user, similar to the &quot;back&quot; button or gesture on Android, would trigger an undo. For text, apps probably won&#39;t even have to implement anything. The Textbox element of the UI framework should be capable of undoing changes. For anything more complex, the app decides what to do with this action.</p>

<p>Again, probably just wishful thinking, but I really want my undos back!</p>
