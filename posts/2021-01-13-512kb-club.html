<p>There is a new (no, not that new) philosophy called <a href="https://leanweb.dev/">the lean web</a>. It essentially tries to keep websites tiny and semantically correct.

<p>In order to get lean, I decided to join <a href="https://512kb.club/">the 512KB club</a>. This website lists sites that are below 512KB in total (uncompressed, with all dependencies). To get below that mark, I had to remove my face from the frontpage (I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll miss it😅), since the image itself was roughly 750KB.

<p>I&#x27;m not planning to stop here though. I think keeping a website small and simple is an excellent practice. My next step will be to get rid of all the JS junk on this site and only rely on HTML and CSS. I still want to be able to write my posts in Markdown, so I will have to come up with a way to generate pages from them. A safe bet for this would be to use a SSG like <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. Frankly, <a href="https://erikwinter.nl/articles/2020/why-i-built-my-own-shitty-static-site-generator/">writing my own simple SSG probably wouldn&#x27;t hurt either</a>.

For that, I apologize in advance!\n\nI'm planning to make two modifications. Firstly, I want to add a `id` property\nto all entries. So far, your reader has been likely been relying on the URL slug\nto identify an entry. Adding the `id` property makes this more flexible, but it\nalso means that your reader will think that there are new entries in the feed.\nThis will only happen once.\n\nSecondly, I want to reduce the amount of the entries. If you look at the\n[feed](/rss.xml), you'll see a lot of junk from way back, containing every word\nI wrote on this blog. Remember that this page is fetched periodically (usually\nevery hour for most readers) by **every** subscriber. That's a lot of traffic\nthat could be better put to use somewhere else. Not that it costs me anything -\nthis site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - but if this\nhelps reduce the carbon footprint of the site even by one gram, it's worth the\neffort.\n\nAs of the time of writing this post, by restricting the number of posts to 10,\nwe reduce the amount of traffic per client per hour from 272 kB down to to 24\nkB. That's over **2 GB** of traffic saved each year **per subscriber**!!\n\nThat's all - just a heads up. Thanks for your patience, you're awesome! ✌️\n\n---\n\nThis is post 071 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"PSA: RSS feed changes","date":"2023-07-06","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, meta, rss"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","meta","rss"]},{"slug":"2023-06-01-single-page-applications-on-github-pages","markdownBody":"\nMy latest project, [sendpasswords.net](https://sendpasswords.net/) is a [Single Page Application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) deployed on GitHub Pages.\n\nGitHub Pages is configured in a way to host static HTML files without any bells and whistles. This means that if you try to fetch a document that's *not* the index, for example `/foo`, the server will try to load the file with that name. \n\nBy nature, SPAs only consist of a single HTML entry point (`index.html` in most cases). It's responsible for routing the user to the correct page if there are multiple paths. And here's the crux: if the user tries to load `/foo`, he will not land at the SPA entry point. Instead, he will see a `404` error.\n\n## The solution\n\nA `404` response will automatically return a file called `404.html`, which we can use to our advantage. After building the application, simply copy the `index.html` to `404.html`, as demonstrated by [this commit](https://github.com/garritfra/sendpasswords.net/commit/66bdb68c229a3ac3386f7816a746155e658eb586). This will use `index.html` to serve the application on the root level, and `404.html` to load *the same app* if the page doesn't exist as a file. Whether the `index.html` is needed if there's already a `404.html` is up to you. I left it in to make clear that this is just a workaround.\n\nThis is a [well known](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69308662/9046809) workaround, but I wanted to bring some extra awareness to it, since it's a problem I ran into a couple of times so far.

Some times I want to write about every thought that crosses my mind, leading to 4+ average- to low-quality posts a week.
