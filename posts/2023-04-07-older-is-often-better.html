After being unhappy with the Bluetooth connectivity in the OnePlus Nord I bought in december of 2020, I bought a brand new Pixel 7 last december. I told myself that t would be using the OnePlus Nord for at least three years, preferably four, yet I gave in after two years due to some issue that could have been fixed with a pair of cable-headphones. I&#x27;m now asking myself again: am I able to use my new Pixel 7 for more than 3 years?</p>
<p>I just stumbled upon a blog post called &quot;<a href="https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/my-long-goodbye-to-windows-xp">My long goodbye to Windows XP</a>&quot;, in which the author explains that he is currently replacing his 2008 laptop running Windows XP with a &quot;new&quot; PC running Windows 7. He states that he knew the ins and outs of this operating system, so why switch to a new one? Eventually he did switch, but to an OS that is already end of life.</p>
<p>I totally love this. If you&#x27;re happy with what you got, you shouldn&#x27;t let a new feature dictate how to change your workflow. Does one really need the features introduced in some software/hardware/tool in the past year? Wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to use the things that have been battle-tested for at least a few years?</p>
<p>As I said, I&#x27;m very guilty of living at the cutting edge of technology. Maybe it&#x27;s time to slow down. I&#x27;m certain it would simplify a lot of things.</p>
