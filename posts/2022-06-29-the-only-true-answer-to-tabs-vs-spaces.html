We&#x27;re starting from a blank page,
so of course this classic question came up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;So should we use tabs or spaces for our formatting?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of my teammates explained to us why the only logical answer to this is
&quot;Tabs&quot;, and you&#x27;ll soon know why.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem" level="2">The problem</h2>
<p>Most formatters, by default, use either two or four spaces for indentation by
default. The <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> formatter does this, and it
somewhat became the norm for JavaScript projects. This has one huge downside
though: everyone on the team has to agree, or live with this standard.</p>
<p>Nowadays, almost all editors come with the ability to change the preferred
indentation settings, which will be overridden by the settings of the
formatter. I prefer an indentation of 4 spaces, which is reflected in all of my
code. If I&#x27;m working on a project that uses an indentation of 2 spaces via
prettier, my preference will be overridden when formatting the code.</p>
<h2 id="just-use-tabs" level="2">Just use tabs</h2>
<p>The solution to this problem is simple: Create a <code>.editorconfig</code> file and set
the indentation style to tab, without a width:</p>
<pre><code class="language-editorconfig">root = true

[*]
end_of_line = lf
charset = utf-8
indent_style = tab
</code></pre>
<p>Almost all editors will be able to pick this file up and configure some
project-wide settings. If your editor is configured to use a indent width of 4,
this setting will be respected. If you&#x27;re a maniac that indents their code with
8 spaces, you&#x27;ll be pleased to see that you can finally use this style in your
code, without forcing anyone else to do as you do.</p>
<p>Even GitHub, GitLab and friends are able to respect this setting, giving
everyone the opportunity to view code in their preferred style.</p>
<p>I hope you now know why using a single tab of indentation makes the most sense if
you&#x27;re working in a team. Let me know your thoughts!</p>

This means that if you try to fetch a document that's *not* the index, for example `/foo`, the server will try to load the file with that name. \n\nBy nature, SPAs only consist of a single HTML entry point (`index.html` in most cases). It's responsible for routing the user to the correct page if there are multiple paths. And here's the crux: if the user tries to load `/foo`, he will not land at the SPA entry point. Instead, he will see a `404` error.\n\n## The solution\n\nA `404` response will automatically return a file called `404.html`, which we can use to our advantage. After building the application, simply copy the `index.html` to `404.html`, as demonstrated by [this commit](https://github.com/garritfra/sendpasswords.net/commit/66bdb68c229a3ac3386f7816a746155e658eb586). This will use `index.html` to serve the application on the root level, and `404.html` to load *the same app* if the page doesn't exist as a file. Whether the `index.html` is needed if there's already a `404.html` is up to you. I left it in to make clear that this is just a workaround.\n\nThis is a [well known](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69308662/9046809) workaround, but I wanted to bring some extra awareness to it, since it's a problem I ran into a couple of times so far.

It's a boardgame about building cities, roads and farms, and each completed \"project\" earns you some amount of points. The twist is that there's only a limited number of tiles, and once all tiles are used, the game is over unfinished projects are discarded.\n\nThe first couple of playthroughs I tried to maximize my score by increasing the number of projects I actively had going. I'd start a new city or road whenever I could, thinking that the multipliers you sometimes get would pay off in the end. Boy was I wrong.\n\nWhere I'm from, we have multiple sayings for this approach. \"Having too many irons in the fire\" or \"dancing on too many parties\". I was too busy starting new projects instead of making actual progress.\n\nA far better approach is to finish projects early, earning less points, but with a greater certainty that they will pay off. With every project you start, the likelyhood of the other projects paying off decreases.\n\nKeeping batch sizes small was a key concept of the [lean manufacturing movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) in the 1980s, and has since been adopted by the [DevOps movement](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) for the IT industry. If you want to learn more about this topic, you should check out [The DevOps Handbook](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-devops-handbook-second-edition/). It goes well beyond the basics of making IT processes more productive and efficient.\n\nAfter realizing that small batch sizes are the key to success, I haven't lost a game of Carcassonne since.

Create and download a full backup through the UI\r\n2. Flash Homeassistant onto the SSD\r\n3. Remove the SD card and plug the SSD into a USB 3.0 port of the Pi\r\n4. Boot\r\n5. Go through the onboarding procedure\r\n6. Restore Backup\r\n7. Profit\r\n\r\nIt worked like a charm! The speed has improved A LOT, and everything was set up as it should be. \r\n\r\n...Until we turned on the lights in the livingroom. My ZigBee-dongle, plugged into another USB port, wasn't able to communicate with the devices on the network.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging around, I came across several threads stating that an SSD over USB 3.0 apparently creates a lot of interference to surrounding hardware, including my ZigBee dongle. The fix was simple: either get an extension port for the dongle, or plug the SSD into a USB 2.0 port of the Pi. Since I didn't have an extension cord to get the dongle far away enough from the SSD, I went with the latter option for now. And that fixed it! The performance was much worse, but still better than the SD I used before. My next step will be to grab an extension cord from my parents. I'm sure they won't mind.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 066 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating Homeassistant from SD to SSD","date":"2023-04-27","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, homeassistant, homelab"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","homeassistant","homelab"]},{"slug":"2023-04-22-the-role-of-a-devops-engineer","markdownBody":"\nThe term \"DevOps\" can be interpreted in many different ways.
