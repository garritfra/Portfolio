Unfortunately, since I&#x27;m using a Mac for day to day work, I have to rely on a virtual machine to run anything Linux-related. VirtualBox doesn&#x27;t support the most recent kernels (5.9 is the most recent supported one), so there won&#x27;t be any cutting-edge development happening here. I decided to use ubuntu as my guest system, since it&#x27;s very easy to set up.</p>
<p>So, the first step is to get the sources. You could simply go ahead and download a specific release from <a href="https://kernel.org/">kernel.org</a>, but since I want to hack on it, I decided to go the git-route. Simply download the sources from <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/">their repo</a> and check out the tag you want to build.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: this might take a while. Their repository is huge! If you want to only need the <code>HEAD</code> and want to build on bare-metal (no VirtualBox), you could only clone the latest commit using <code>git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git --depth=1</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next up, you need to generate a <code>.config</code>. This file describes which features you want to compile into your kernel. To make a generic config that only compiles drivers for the hardware of your system, you can run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Copy the config of your current kernel into the repo
make oldconfig

# Only enable modules that are currently used by the system
make localmodconfig
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let&#x27;s get to actually compiling the kernel. In my case, I assigned 4 cores to my VM. The <code>-j</code> option tells make to run 4 jobs in parallel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Caution</strong>: Just providing -j will freeze your system, since make will try to launch an infinite amount of processes!</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>make -j4
</code></pre>
<p>Again, this might take some time. Go for a walk, get a coffee or watch your favorite TV-show. After compilation has finished, we need to install the kernel. To do so, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo make modules_install
sudo make install
</code></pre>
<p>In order to boot, we need to tell our bootloader about our new kernel. Run this command to update your grub config:</p>
<pre><code>sudo update-grub2
</code></pre>
<p>And voila! Your new kernel should be ready.</p>
<p>Reboot the system, and grub should pick up the new kernel and boot to it. If that&#x27;s not the case, you should be able to pick the kernel from the grub menu under <code>advanced options</code>.</p>
<h2 id="retrospective" level="2">Retrospective</h2>
<p>I found that building my own kernel is a highly educational and fun experience. Using VirtualBox is a pain in the <code>/dev/null</code> to work with, since it has to add a lot of overhead to the system in order to work. You sometimes have to wait over 6 month until the support for a new kernel arrives. This problem should not apply if you compile on bare metal systems.</p>

This means that if you try to fetch a document that's *not* the index, for example `/foo`, the server will try to load the file with that name. \n\nBy nature, SPAs only consist of a single HTML entry point (`index.html` in most cases). It's responsible for routing the user to the correct page if there are multiple paths. And here's the crux: if the user tries to load `/foo`, he will not land at the SPA entry point. Instead, he will see a `404` error.\n\n## The solution\n\nA `404` response will automatically return a file called `404.html`, which we can use to our advantage. After building the application, simply copy the `index.html` to `404.html`, as demonstrated by [this commit](https://github.com/garritfra/sendpasswords.net/commit/66bdb68c229a3ac3386f7816a746155e658eb586). This will use `index.html` to serve the application on the root level, and `404.html` to load *the same app* if the page doesn't exist as a file. Whether the `index.html` is needed if there's already a `404.html` is up to you. I left it in to make clear that this is just a workaround.\n\nThis is a [well known](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69308662/9046809) workaround, but I wanted to bring some extra awareness to it, since it's a problem I ran into a couple of times so far.

It's expected that \u003e 50k Users hit the platform within a five minute period. Regular ECS containers take about one minute to scale up. That just won't cut it. I decided to go all in on the [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) framework on AWS. Here's how it went.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nSetting up a serverless application was a breeze. You create a config file and use their CLI to deploy the app.\r\n\r\n### The rest of the infrastructure\r\n\r\nI decided to define the rest of the infrastructure (VPC, DB, cache, ...) in Terraform. But, since I wasn't familiar with how the Serverless Framework worked, I struggled to draw the line between what serverless should handle vs. what the rest of the infrastructure (Terraform) should provide. In a more traditional deployment workflow, you might let the CI deploy a container image to ECR and point the ECS service to that new image.\r\n\r\nI chose to let Serverless deploy the entire app through CI and build the rest of the infrastructure around it. The problem with this approach is that we lose fine-grained control over what's deployed where, which leads to a lot of permission errors.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, I should've probably chosen the location of the S3 archive as the deployment target for the CI, and then point the lambda function to the location of the new artifact. This defeats the purpose of the framework, but it gives you a lot more control over your infrastructure. Once the next project comes along, I'll probably go that route instead.\r\n\r\n### Permissions\r\n\r\nServerless suggests to use admin permissions for deployments, and I see where they're coming from. Managing permissions in this framework is an absolute mess. Here's what the average deployment workflow looks like, if you want to use fine grained permissions:\r\n\r\n1. Wait for CloudFormation to roll back changes (~2 minutes)\r\n2. Update IAM role\r\n3. Deploy Serverless App\r\n4. If there's an error, go to 1\r\n\r\nThankfully, some people have already gone through the process of figuring this out. [Here's](https://serverlessfirst.com/create-iam-deployer-roles-serverless-app/#determining-deploy-time-permissions) a great guide with a starting point of the needed permissions.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nUsing the serverless framework is a solid choice if you just want to throw an app out there. Unfortunately the app I was deploying isn't \"just\" a dynamic website. The next time I'm building a serverless application it's probably not going to be with the Serverless Framework, though I learned a lot about serverless applications in general.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 067 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Serverless Framework Retrospective","date":"2023-04-28","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, note, terraform, learnings, devops, serverless"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","note","terraform","learnings","devops","serverless"]},{"slug":"2023-04-27-migrating-homeassistant-from-sd-to-ssd","markdownBody":"\nI finally got frustrated with the performance of my Raspberry Pi 4 running Homeassistant on a SD card, so I went ahead and got an SSD.\r\n\r\nThe migration was **very** easy:\r\n\r\n1.

My ZigBee-dongle, plugged into another USB port, wasn't able to communicate with the devices on the network.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging around, I came across several threads stating that an SSD over USB 3.0 apparently creates a lot of interference to surrounding hardware, including my ZigBee dongle. The fix was simple: either get an extension port for the dongle, or plug the SSD into a USB 2.0 port of the Pi. Since I didn't have an extension cord to get the dongle far away enough from the SSD, I went with the latter option for now. And that fixed it! The performance was much worse, but still better than the SD I used before. My next step will be to grab an extension cord from my parents. I'm sure they won't mind.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 066 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating Homeassistant from SD to SSD","date":"2023-04-27","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, homeassistant, homelab"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","homeassistant","homelab"]},{"slug":"2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme","markdownBody":"\nThanks to [Jacksons](https://jacksonchen666.com/) [update to darktheme.club](https://github.com/garritfra/darktheme.club/pull/79), I just came across a neat little [CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) that turns a mostly CSS-free document into a pleasantly dark site:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n  color-scheme: light dark;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will adjust all elements on the page to the color scheme preferred by the user - without any other custom styles! ðŸ¤¯ It is also [widely supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_color-scheme) by browsers.\r\n\r\nI've always been quite dependent on CSS-frameworks for any project I'm starting.

During the development, I learned a lot about designing components to be resilient and scalable. Here are some key takeaways.\r\n\r\nOne of the most critical components of a resilient infrastructure is redundancy. On AWS, you place your components inside a \"region\". This could be `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt) or `us-east-1` (North Virgina), etc. To further reduce the risk of an outage, each region is divided into multiple [Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html) (AZs). The AZs of a region are usually located some distance apart from each other. In case of a flood, a fire or a bomb detonating near one AZ, the other AZs should in most cases still be intact. You should have at least two, preferably three replicas of each component across multiple availability zones in a region. By having replicas of your components in different availability zones, you reduce the risk of downtime caused by an outage in a single availability zone.\r\n\r\nAnother way to ensure scalability and resilience for your database is to use [Aurora Serverless v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.html). This database service is specifically designed for scalable, on-demand, and cost-effective performance. The database scales itself up or down based on the workload, which allows you to automatically and dynamically adjust the database capacity to meet the demand of your application, ensuring that your application is responsive and performs well without the need for manual intervention. Adding Serverless instances to an existing RDS cluster is also a seemless proccess.\r\n\r\nIn addition to switching to Aurora Serverless v2, using read replicas for cache and database in a separate availability zone can act as a hot standby without extra configuration. Keep in mind that read replicas are only utilized by explicitly using the read-only endpoint of a cluster. But even if you're only using the \"main\" cluster endpoint (and therefore just the primary instance), a read replica can promote itself to the primary instance in case of a fail over, which drastically reduces downtime.\r\n\r\nWhen using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), use Fargate as opposed to EC2 instances. Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows you to run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. It smartly locates instances across availability zones, ensuring that your application is always available.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, you should always ensure that there are more than one instance of a component in your infrastructure. There are also services on AWS that abstract away the physical infrastructure (Fargate, S3, Lambda) and use a multi-AZ pattern by default.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 061 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Designing resilient cloud infrastructure","date":"2023-03-30","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, guide, note, learnings"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","guide","note","learnings"]}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[post]","query":{"post":"2021-01-15-compiling-your-own-kernel"},"buildId":"VYPhm2fTttAtwRaZriPSY","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
