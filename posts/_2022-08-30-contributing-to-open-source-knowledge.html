<p>I&#x27;m currently away from my laptop, traveling through Norway in a rented campervan. While roaming the beautiful landscapes, I spend a lot of time thinking. Reading books while traveling really is the best way to find new inspiration.</p>
<p>On our trip, we wanted to try out an alternative to Google Maps. Most of the OpenStreetMap-based apps lack important features, but we recently stumbled upon <a href="https://www.magicearth.com/">MagicEarth</a>, which perfectly fills the void. OpenStreetMap has been 95% accurate for us. Those last 5% are mostly less famous hiking trails and attractions that could easily be filled in by people like you and I, which served as the inspiration for this blog-post.</p>
<p>Here are 6 ways to contribute open source knowledge right now:</p>
<h2 id="openstreetmap" level="2">OpenStreetMap</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, I spotted some minor inconsistencies in <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> while driving through Norway. We tracked our hikes with an app that is able to export a GPX file, which can be imported to OpenStreetMap to check if the trail matches (or if it is missing), and took note of incorrect or sloppy roads/buildings. Back home, I plan to sit down and fix up those issues.</p>
<p>But you don&#x27;t have to be on a roadtrip to contribute to OpenStreetMap! Chances are you know your local surroundings pretty well. Just navigate to your neighborhood and see what could be improved. Maybe you know a public toilet, a park or a secret road that is not shown on the map? As a matter of fact, my private address was missing, so I added it via the editor. I can now use any of the many OpenStreetMap-based apps to navigate home!</p>
<h2 id="wikipedia-(and-other-wikis)" level="2">Wikipedia (and other wikis)</h2>
<p>I often feel like I can&#x27;t contribute much to the vast knowledge of Wikipedia. <em>Other people are way smarter than me</em> and whatnot. But while you might not be able to publish worthy edits to a well-known topic, you might know some things that others haven&#x27;t thought of. Is there an entry about your local town? Is there an interesting member of your (past) family that others might want to read about?</p>
<p>Of course, there are other wikis beside Wikipedia. Are you using a little-known tool that has open source documentation in the form of a wiki? How can it be improved?</p>
<h2 id="observation" level="2">Observation</h2>
<p>You might have never heard of <a href="https://observation.org">observation.org</a>. It&#x27;s an open biodiversity- and nature-database. I just recently learned about them in our local museum. They had a special exhibition about insects, and called out for contributions to map out our local flora and fauna.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: snap a picture of an interesting looking insect or plant, upload it using the website (or one of their apps) and create an &quot;observation&quot;. Using this information, researchers will be able to understand the biodiversity of your area. The information is free to use, and anyone can contribute!</p>
<h2 id="wardriving" level="2">Wardriving</h2>
<p>&quot;Wardriving&quot; is the process of driving around by bike or car and mapping out the networks around you.</p>
