It's expected that \u003e 50k Users hit the platform within a five minute period. Regular ECS containers take about one minute to scale up. That just won't cut it. I decided to go all in on the [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) framework on AWS. Here's how it went.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nSetting up a serverless application was a breeze. You create a config file and use their CLI to deploy the app.\r\n\r\n### The rest of the infrastructure\r\n\r\nI decided to define the rest of the infrastructure (VPC, DB, cache, ...) in Terraform. But, since I wasn't familiar with how the Serverless Framework worked, I struggled to draw the line between what serverless should handle vs. what the rest of the infrastructure (Terraform) should provide. In a more traditional deployment workflow, you might let the CI deploy a container image to ECR and point the ECS service to that new image.\r\n\r\nI chose to let Serverless deploy the entire app through CI and build the rest of the infrastructure around it. The problem with this approach is that we lose fine-grained control over what's deployed where, which leads to a lot of permission errors.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, I should've probably chosen the location of the S3 archive as the deployment target for the CI, and then point the lambda function to the location of the new artifact. This defeats the purpose of the framework, but it gives you a lot more control over your infrastructure. Once the next project comes along, I'll probably go that route instead.\r\n\r\n### Permissions\r\n\r\nServerless suggests to use admin permissions for deployments, and I see where they're coming from. Managing permissions in this framework is an absolute mess. Here's what the average deployment workflow looks like, if you want to use fine grained permissions:\r\n\r\n1. Wait for CloudFormation to roll back changes (~2 minutes)\r\n2. Update IAM role\r\n3. Deploy Serverless App\r\n4. If there's an error, go to 1\r\n\r\nThankfully, some people have already gone through the process of figuring this out. [Here's](https://serverlessfirst.com/create-iam-deployer-roles-serverless-app/#determining-deploy-time-permissions) a great guide with a starting point of the needed permissions.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nUsing the serverless framework is a solid choice if you just want to throw an app out there. Unfortunately the app I was deploying isn't \"just\" a dynamic website. The next time I'm building a serverless application it's probably not going to be with the Serverless Framework, though I learned a lot about serverless applications in general.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 067 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Serverless Framework Retrospective","date":"2023-04-28","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, note, terraform, learnings, devops, serverless"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","note","terraform","learnings","devops","serverless"]},{"slug":"2023-03-30-designing-resilient-cloud-infrastructure","markdownBody":"\r\nAs mentioned in a [previous post](/posts/2023-03-16-terraform-project-learnings), I'm currently finishing up building my first cloud infrastructure on AWS for a client at work. During the development, I learned a lot about designing components to be resilient and scalable. Here are some key takeaways.\r\n\r\nOne of the most critical components of a resilient infrastructure is redundancy. On AWS, you place your components inside a \"region\". This could be `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt) or `us-east-1` (North Virgina), etc. To further reduce the risk of an outage, each region is divided into multiple [Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html) (AZs). The AZs of a region are usually located some distance apart from each other. In case of a flood, a fire or a bomb detonating near one AZ, the other AZs should in most cases still be intact. You should have at least two, preferably three replicas of each component across multiple availability zones in a region. By having replicas of your components in different availability zones, you reduce the risk of downtime caused by an outage in a single availability zone.\r\n\r\nAnother way to ensure scalability and resilience for your database is to use [Aurora Serverless v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.html). This database service is specifically designed for scalable, on-demand, and cost-effective performance. The database scales itself up or down based on the workload, which allows you to automatically and dynamically adjust the database capacity to meet the demand of your application, ensuring that your application is responsive and performs well without the need for manual intervention. Adding Serverless instances to an existing RDS cluster is also a seemless proccess.\r\n\r\nIn addition to switching to Aurora Serverless v2, using read replicas for cache and database in a separate availability zone can act as a hot standby without extra configuration. Keep in mind that read replicas are only utilized by explicitly using the read-only endpoint of a cluster. But even if you're only using the \"main\" cluster endpoint (and therefore just the primary instance), a read replica can promote itself to the primary instance in case of a fail over, which drastically reduces downtime.\r\n\r\nWhen using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), use Fargate as opposed to EC2 instances. Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows you to run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. It smartly locates instances across availability zones, ensuring that your application is always available.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, you should always ensure that there are more than one instance of a component in your infrastructure. There are also services on AWS that abstract away the physical infrastructure (Fargate, S3, Lambda) and use a multi-AZ pattern by default.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 061 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Designing resilient cloud infrastructure","date":"2023-03-30","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, guide, note, learnings"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","guide","note","learnings"]},{"slug":"2023-03-16-terraform-project-learnings","markdownBody":"\r\nI just finished my first ever infrastructure project for a client. My Terraform skills are good enough to be dangerous, but during the development of this project I learned a lot that I would do differently next time.\r\n\r\n## Project structure\r\n\r\nHaving worked with semi-professional Terraform code before, I applied what I knew to my new project. That was mainly that we have a shared base and an overlay directory for each environment. I went with a single Terraform module for the shared infrastructure, and variables for each environment. Naively, roughly every service had their own file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ modules\r\nâ”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ infrastructure\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ alb.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ cache.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ database.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ dns.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ ecr.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ ecs.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ iam.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ logs.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ network.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ secrets.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ security.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ ssl.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ state.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ variables.tf\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ production\r\nâ”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ secrets.tf\r\nâ””â”€â”€ staging\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf\r\n    â””â”€â”€ secrets.tf\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works very well, but I already started running into issues extending this setup. For my next project, I would probably find individual components and turn them into smaller reusable submodules. If I were to rewrite the project above, I would probably structure it like this (not a complete project, but I think you get the idea):\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ modules\r\nâ”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ infrastructure\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ modules\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ database\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ iam.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ logs.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ rds.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ variables.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ loadbalancer\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ alb.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ logs.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ variables.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ network\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ dns.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ logs.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ssl.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ vpc.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ service\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ecr.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ecs.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ iam.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ logs.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ variables.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ state\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ locks.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ s3.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ variables.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ variables.tf\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ production\r\nâ”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf\r\nâ”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ secrets.tf\r\nâ””â”€â”€ staging\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf\r\n    â””â”€â”€ secrets.tf\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Secrets\r\n\r\nI decided to use [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) to manage secrets, but that was only before I learned about [SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops). It's too late to migrate now, but if I could, I would choose SOPS for secrets any day of the week for upcoming projects. It even has a [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/carlpett/sops/latest/docs), so there's no excuse not to use it. ;)\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nOverall I'm pretty happy with how the project turned out, but there are some things that I learned during this project that will pay off later.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 057 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Terraform project learnings","date":"2023-03-16","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, note, terraform, learnings"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","note","terraform","learnings"]},{"slug":"2023-03-10-debugging-ecs-tasks","markdownBody":"\r\nI just had to debug an application on AWS ECS. The whole procedure is documented in more detail in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-exec.html), but I think it's beneficial (both for my future self and hopefully to someone out there) to write down the proccess in my own words.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you need access to the cluster via the [CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/de/cli/). In addition to the CLI, you need the [AWS Session Manager plugin for the CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html). If you're on MacOS, you can install that via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/session-manager-plugin):\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew install --cask session-manager-plugin\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, you need to allow the task you want to debug to be able to execute commands. Since I'm using Terraform, this was just a matter of adding the [`enable_execute_command`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/ecs_service#enable_execute_command) attribute to the service:\r\n\r\n```tf\r\nresource \"aws_ecs_service\" \"my_service\" {\r\n  name            = \"my-service\"\r\n  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.my_cluster.id\r\n  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.my_task_definition.id\r\n  desired_count   = var.app_count\r\n  launch_type     = \"FARGATE\"\r\n  enable_execute_command = true # TODO: Disable after debugging\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may also need specify an execution role in the task definition:\r\n\r\n```tf\r\nresource \"aws_ecs_task_definition\" \"my_task_definition\" {\r\n  family              = \"my-task\"\r\n  task_role_arn       = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_execution_role.arn\r\n  execution_role_arn  = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_execution_role.arn  # \u003c-- Add this\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure that this role has the correct access rights. There's a nice [troubleshooting guide](https://aws.amazon.com/de/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ecs-error-execute-command/) going over the required permissions.\r\n\r\nIf you had to do some modifications, make sure to roll out a new deployment with the fresh settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\naws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service my-service --force-new-deployment\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, you should be able to issue commands against any running container!\r\n\r\n```\r\naws ecs execute-command --cluster westfalen --task \u003ctask-id-or-arn\u003e --container my-container --interactive --command=\"/bin/sh\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 055 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Debugging ECS Tasks","date":"2023-03-10","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, guide, note, terraform"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","guide","note","terraform"]},{"slug":"2023-03-08-terraform-and-kubernetes-are-fundamentally-different","markdownBody":"\r\nOn the surface, Infrastructure as Code tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) or [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/de/cloudformation/) may seem to behave similar to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) YAMLs, but they are in fact fundamentally different approaches to cloud infrastructure.\r\n\r\nTerraform tries to provide a declarative way to express imperative actions. If you tell Terraform that you need an EC2 instance, it will notice that no such resource exists and instruct the AWS API to create one. If you don't need the instance anymore and remove the resource definition from your code, Terraform will also pick that up and instruct the AWS API to delete the instance. This works well in most cases, but every once in a while the declarative state may get out of sync with the real world, resulting in errors that are hard to debug and resolve.\r\n\r\nKubernetes on the other hand is a fully declarative system. In a [previous post](/posts/2022-09-22-kubernetes-is-a-domain-specific-database) I touched on how Kubernetes constantly compares the *desired* state with the *actual* state of the resources and tries to match the two. Although it is theoretically possible to issue imperative actions, Kubernetes is built from the ground up to be declarative.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 054 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"The fundamental difference between Terraform and Kubernetes","date":"2023-03-08","tags":"note, infrastructure, terraform, kubernetes, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["note","infrastructure","terraform","kubernetes","100DaysToOffload"]}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[post]","query":{"post":"2023-02-20-what-problem-does-kubernetes-solve"},"buildId":"VYPhm2fTttAtwRaZriPSY","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
