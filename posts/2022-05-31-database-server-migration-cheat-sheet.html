To remember how to
do it next time, I&#x27;m writing down the commands I used here.</p>
<p>I usually just shut down the database and then copy the local directory where
the volume was mounted onto the new host. This time though, I seemed to be
getting some I/O errors, so I had to do it the &quot;right&quot; way.</p>
<p>To be fair, this note is based on
<a href="https://www.netguru.com/blog/how-to-dump-and-restore-postgresql-database">this</a>
guide. I modified it to fit my workflow with docker.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-dump" level="2">Creating a dump</h2>
<p>Log into the old host:</p>
<pre><code>ssh &lt;user&gt;@host
</code></pre>
<p>Connect to the postgres-container:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec -ti myservice_db_1 /bin/bash
</code></pre>
<p>Create a dump. You can name your dump as you wish - I&#x27;m using dates to
distinguish multiple dumps:</p>
<pre><code>pg_dump -U db_user db_name &gt; db_name_20220531.sql
</code></pre>
<p>Copy the dump to the host machine:</p>
<pre><code>docker cp myservice_db_1:/db_name_20220531.sql ~/
</code></pre>
<h2 id="moving-the-dump-to-the-new-host" level="2">Moving the dump to the new host</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get the dump off of the old server and onto the new one is to
use your local machine as a middleman.</p>
<p>First, download the dump to your machine:</p>
<pre><code>scp &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:~/db_name_20220531.sql .
</code></pre>
<p>Then, do the same thing but reversed, with the new host:</p>
<pre><code>scp ./db_name_20220531.sql &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:~/
</code></pre>
<h2 id="restoring-the-dump" level="2">Restoring the dump</h2>
<p>First, connect to the new host:</p>
<pre><code>ssh &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming the docker service is already running on the new host, attach to the
db-container, just like above:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec -ti myservice_db_1 /bin/bash
</code></pre>
<p>This time, we have to do some fiddling on the database, so attach a session to
postgres using their cli:</p>
<pre><code>psql -U my_user
</code></pre>
<p>Before &quot;resetting&quot; the existing DB to apply the dump, we have to connect to
another database. The <code>postgres</code> DB is always there, so you can use that.</p>
<pre><code>\c postgres
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we drop the existing DB and re-add it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">drop database database_name;
create database database_name with owner your_user_name;
</code></pre>
<p>And now, the moment you&#x27;ve been waiting for! Leave the psql-session and apply
the dump:</p>
<pre><code>psql -U db_user db_name &lt; db_name_20220531.sql
</code></pre>
<p>That&#x27;s all! You now have the exact copy of production database available on your
machine.</p>

This means that if you try to fetch a document that's *not* the index, for example `/foo`, the server will try to load the file with that name. \n\nBy nature, SPAs only consist of a single HTML entry point (`index.html` in most cases). It's responsible for routing the user to the correct page if there are multiple paths. And here's the crux: if the user tries to load `/foo`, he will not land at the SPA entry point. Instead, he will see a `404` error.\n\n## The solution\n\nA `404` response will automatically return a file called `404.html`, which we can use to our advantage. After building the application, simply copy the `index.html` to `404.html`, as demonstrated by [this commit](https://github.com/garritfra/sendpasswords.net/commit/66bdb68c229a3ac3386f7816a746155e658eb586). This will use `index.html` to serve the application on the root level, and `404.html` to load *the same app* if the page doesn't exist as a file. Whether the `index.html` is needed if there's already a `404.html` is up to you. I left it in to make clear that this is just a workaround.\n\nThis is a [well known](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69308662/9046809) workaround, but I wanted to bring some extra awareness to it, since it's a problem I ran into a couple of times so far.

Create and download a full backup through the UI\r\n2. Flash Homeassistant onto the SSD\r\n3. Remove the SD card and plug the SSD into a USB 3.0 port of the Pi\r\n4. Boot\r\n5. Go through the onboarding procedure\r\n6. Restore Backup\r\n7. Profit\r\n\r\nIt worked like a charm! The speed has improved A LOT, and everything was set up as it should be. \r\n\r\n...Until we turned on the lights in the livingroom. My ZigBee-dongle, plugged into another USB port, wasn't able to communicate with the devices on the network.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging around, I came across several threads stating that an SSD over USB 3.0 apparently creates a lot of interference to surrounding hardware, including my ZigBee dongle. The fix was simple: either get an extension port for the dongle, or plug the SSD into a USB 2.0 port of the Pi. Since I didn't have an extension cord to get the dongle far away enough from the SSD, I went with the latter option for now. And that fixed it! The performance was much worse, but still better than the SD I used before. My next step will be to grab an extension cord from my parents. I'm sure they won't mind.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 066 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating Homeassistant from SD to SSD","date":"2023-04-27","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, homeassistant, homelab"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","homeassistant","homelab"]},{"slug":"2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme","markdownBody":"\nThanks to [Jacksons](https://jacksonchen666.com/) [update to darktheme.club](https://github.com/garritfra/darktheme.club/pull/79), I just came across a neat little [CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) that turns a mostly CSS-free document into a pleasantly dark site:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n  color-scheme: light dark;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will adjust all elements on the page to the color scheme preferred by the user - without any other custom styles! ðŸ¤¯ It is also [widely supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_color-scheme) by browsers.\r\n\r\nI've always been quite dependent on CSS-frameworks for any project I'm starting.

During the development, I learned a lot about designing components to be resilient and scalable. Here are some key takeaways.\r\n\r\nOne of the most critical components of a resilient infrastructure is redundancy. On AWS, you place your components inside a \"region\". This could be `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt) or `us-east-1` (North Virgina), etc. To further reduce the risk of an outage, each region is divided into multiple [Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html) (AZs). The AZs of a region are usually located some distance apart from each other. In case of a flood, a fire or a bomb detonating near one AZ, the other AZs should in most cases still be intact. You should have at least two, preferably three replicas of each component across multiple availability zones in a region. By having replicas of your components in different availability zones, you reduce the risk of downtime caused by an outage in a single availability zone.\r\n\r\nAnother way to ensure scalability and resilience for your database is to use [Aurora Serverless v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.html). This database service is specifically designed for scalable, on-demand, and cost-effective performance. The database scales itself up or down based on the workload, which allows you to automatically and dynamically adjust the database capacity to meet the demand of your application, ensuring that your application is responsive and performs well without the need for manual intervention. Adding Serverless instances to an existing RDS cluster is also a seemless proccess.\r\n\r\nIn addition to switching to Aurora Serverless v2, using read replicas for cache and database in a separate availability zone can act as a hot standby without extra configuration. Keep in mind that read replicas are only utilized by explicitly using the read-only endpoint of a cluster. But even if you're only using the \"main\" cluster endpoint (and therefore just the primary instance), a read replica can promote itself to the primary instance in case of a fail over, which drastically reduces downtime.\r\n\r\nWhen using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), use Fargate as opposed to EC2 instances. Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows you to run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. It smartly locates instances across availability zones, ensuring that your application is always available.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, you should always ensure that there are more than one instance of a component in your infrastructure. There are also services on AWS that abstract away the physical infrastructure (Fargate, S3, Lambda) and use a multi-AZ pattern by default.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 061 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Designing resilient cloud infrastructure","date":"2023-03-30","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, guide, note, learnings"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","guide","note","learnings"]},{"slug":"2023-03-23-fullscreen-terminals-in-vscode","markdownBody":"\nI often find myself using a \"real\" terminal alongside my VSCode setup, because for some tasks the built-in terminal, due to its small size, is quite flimsy to use. *But*!
