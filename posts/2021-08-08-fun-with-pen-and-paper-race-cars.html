pen and some paper. One of those games was called &quot;Race Cars&quot; and I wondered
how on earth you would play a racing game on paper, and the answer is: simple
math!</p>
<h2 id="the-core-idea" level="2">The core idea</h2>
<p>The goal of the game is to cross the finish line of a hand-drawn race track
first without hitting the edge. Race cars have a velocity that can be adjusted
each move. If you&#x27;re too greedy, you will crash. If you hit the breaks too
early, another player will win.</p>
<h2 id="how-it&#x27;s-played" level="2">How it&#x27;s played</h2>
<p>We start out with a hand-drawn race track. The shape really can be anything you
like. Just be creative!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/paperracer/0.jpg" alt="A race track on paper"/></p>
<p>Next, each player makes a cross on the starting line. This resembles the
players racecar. Right now, none of the cars is moving. They have a velocity of
0 on the x axis and 0 on the y axis.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/paperracer/1.jpg" alt="Two crosses on the starting line"/></p>
<p>Each move, a player can accelerate or decelerate his vehicle by 1 on any axis.
The first move of each player is somewhat obvious. They want to accelerate
straight forward. On our race track, that means accelerate by 1 on the y axis.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/paperracer/2.jpg" alt="A race car made a move"/></p>
<p>Next, we can either keep on accelerating like the red player does, or &quot;turn&quot;
our vehicle left by changing our y velocity from 0 to -1, which gives us a
velocity of -1, 1.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/paperracer/3.jpg" alt="Paper race cars after two moves"/></p>
<p>On a long stretch, the red player wants to overtake blue by keeping his foot on
the paddle. Blue on the other hand plays it safe and hits the breaks.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/paperracer/4.jpg" alt="Paper race cars on a long stretch"/></p>
<p>Soon after, red realizes his mistake. Being so busy trying to turn, he&#x27;s unable
to hit the breaks. A crash is inevitable. Blue however continues to take the
turn nice and slow. His humble mind brought him victory!</p>

<h2 id="it&#x27;s-all-about-fun" level="2">It&#x27;s all about fun</h2>
<p>The concept of this game is very flexible. You can play it with a friend and
see who&#x27;s the fastest paper racer, or by yourself and try to beat your record.
Getting tired of just cruising around? Introduce the concept of &quot;items&quot; that
give you a boost or slow down the opponent (think Mario Kart!). If ordinary
tracks are boring, try adding intersections or obstacles. Can you add a third
dimension? The sky is the limit. Get out there and be creative.</p>
