pen and some paper. One of those games was called &quot;Race Cars&quot; and I wondered
how on earth you would play a racing game on paper, and the answer is: simple
math!</p>
<h2 id="the-core-idea" level="2">The core idea</h2>
<p>The goal of the game is to cross the finish line of a hand-drawn race track
first without hitting the edge. Race cars have a velocity that can be adjusted
each move. If you&#x27;re too greedy, you will crash. If you hit the breaks too
early, another player will win.</p>
<h2 id="how-it&#x27;s-played" level="2">How it&#x27;s played</h2>
<p>We start out with a hand-drawn race track. The shape really can be anything you
like. Just be creative!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/paperracer/0.jpg" alt="A race track on paper"/></p>
<p>Next, each player makes a cross on the starting line. This resembles the
players racecar. Right now, none of the cars is moving. They have a velocity of
0 on the x axis and 0 on the y axis.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/paperracer/1.jpg" alt="Two crosses on the starting line"/></p>
<p>Each move, a player can accelerate or decelerate his vehicle by 1 on any axis.
The first move of each player is somewhat obvious. They want to accelerate
straight forward. On our race track, that means accelerate by 1 on the y axis.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/paperracer/2.jpg" alt="A race car made a move"/></p>
<p>Next, we can either keep on accelerating like the red player does, or &quot;turn&quot;
our vehicle left by changing our y velocity from 0 to -1, which gives us a
velocity of -1, 1.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/paperracer/3.jpg" alt="Paper race cars after two moves"/></p>
<p>On a long stretch, the red player wants to overtake blue by keeping his foot on
the paddle. Blue on the other hand plays it safe and hits the breaks.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/paperracer/4.jpg" alt="Paper race cars on a long stretch"/></p>
<p>Soon after, red realizes his mistake. Being so busy trying to turn, he&#x27;s unable
to hit the breaks. A crash is inevitable. Blue however continues to take the
turn nice and slow. His humble mind brought him victory!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/paperracer/5.jpg" alt="The red player right before crashing into a wall"/></p>
<h2 id="it&#x27;s-all-about-fun" level="2">It&#x27;s all about fun</h2>
<p>The concept of this game is very flexible. You can play it with a friend and
see who&#x27;s the fastest paper racer, or by yourself and try to beat your record.
Getting tired of just cruising around? Introduce the concept of &quot;items&quot; that
give you a boost or slow down the opponent (think Mario Kart!). If ordinary
tracks are boring, try adding intersections or obstacles. Can you add a third
dimension? The sky is the limit. Get out there and be creative.</p>

This means that if you try to fetch a document that's *not* the index, for example `/foo`, the server will try to load the file with that name. \n\nBy nature, SPAs only consist of a single HTML entry point (`index.html` in most cases). It's responsible for routing the user to the correct page if there are multiple paths. And here's the crux: if the user tries to load `/foo`, he will not land at the SPA entry point. Instead, he will see a `404` error.\n\n## The solution\n\nA `404` response will automatically return a file called `404.html`, which we can use to our advantage. After building the application, simply copy the `index.html` to `404.html`, as demonstrated by [this commit](https://github.com/garritfra/sendpasswords.net/commit/66bdb68c229a3ac3386f7816a746155e658eb586). This will use `index.html` to serve the application on the root level, and `404.html` to load *the same app* if the page doesn't exist as a file. Whether the `index.html` is needed if there's already a `404.html` is up to you. I left it in to make clear that this is just a workaround.\n\nThis is a [well known](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69308662/9046809) workaround, but I wanted to bring some extra awareness to it, since it's a problem I ran into a couple of times so far.

Create and download a full backup through the UI\r\n2. Flash Homeassistant onto the SSD\r\n3. Remove the SD card and plug the SSD into a USB 3.0 port of the Pi\r\n4. Boot\r\n5. Go through the onboarding procedure\r\n6. Restore Backup\r\n7. Profit\r\n\r\nIt worked like a charm! The speed has improved A LOT, and everything was set up as it should be. \r\n\r\n...Until we turned on the lights in the livingroom. My ZigBee-dongle, plugged into another USB port, wasn't able to communicate with the devices on the network.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging around, I came across several threads stating that an SSD over USB 3.0 apparently creates a lot of interference to surrounding hardware, including my ZigBee dongle. The fix was simple: either get an extension port for the dongle, or plug the SSD into a USB 2.0 port of the Pi. Since I didn't have an extension cord to get the dongle far away enough from the SSD, I went with the latter option for now. And that fixed it! The performance was much worse, but still better than the SD I used before. My next step will be to grab an extension cord from my parents. I'm sure they won't mind.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 066 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating Homeassistant from SD to SSD","date":"2023-04-27","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, homeassistant, homelab"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","homeassistant","homelab"]},{"slug":"2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme","markdownBody":"\nThanks to [Jacksons](https://jacksonchen666.com/) [update to darktheme.club](https://github.com/garritfra/darktheme.club/pull/79), I just came across a neat little [CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) that turns a mostly CSS-free document into a pleasantly dark site:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n  color-scheme: light dark;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will adjust all elements on the page to the color scheme preferred by the user - without any other custom styles! ðŸ¤¯ It is also [widely supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_color-scheme) by browsers.\r\n\r\nI've always been quite dependent on CSS-frameworks for any project I'm starting.

During the development, I learned a lot about designing components to be resilient and scalable. Here are some key takeaways.\r\n\r\nOne of the most critical components of a resilient infrastructure is redundancy. On AWS, you place your components inside a \"region\". This could be `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt) or `us-east-1` (North Virgina), etc. To further reduce the risk of an outage, each region is divided into multiple [Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html) (AZs). The AZs of a region are usually located some distance apart from each other. In case of a flood, a fire or a bomb detonating near one AZ, the other AZs should in most cases still be intact. You should have at least two, preferably three replicas of each component across multiple availability zones in a region. By having replicas of your components in different availability zones, you reduce the risk of downtime caused by an outage in a single availability zone.\r\n\r\nAnother way to ensure scalability and resilience for your database is to use [Aurora Serverless v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.html). This database service is specifically designed for scalable, on-demand, and cost-effective performance. The database scales itself up or down based on the workload, which allows you to automatically and dynamically adjust the database capacity to meet the demand of your application, ensuring that your application is responsive and performs well without the need for manual intervention. Adding Serverless instances to an existing RDS cluster is also a seemless proccess.\r\n\r\nIn addition to switching to Aurora Serverless v2, using read replicas for cache and database in a separate availability zone can act as a hot standby without extra configuration. Keep in mind that read replicas are only utilized by explicitly using the read-only endpoint of a cluster. But even if you're only using the \"main\" cluster endpoint (and therefore just the primary instance), a read replica can promote itself to the primary instance in case of a fail over, which drastically reduces downtime.\r\n\r\nWhen using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), use Fargate as opposed to EC2 instances. Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows you to run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. It smartly locates instances across availability zones, ensuring that your application is always available.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, you should always ensure that there are more than one instance of a component in your infrastructure. There are also services on AWS that abstract away the physical infrastructure (Fargate, S3, Lambda) and use a multi-AZ pattern by default.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 061 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Designing resilient cloud infrastructure","date":"2023-03-30","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, guide, note, learnings"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","guide","note","learnings"]},{"slug":"2023-03-23-fullscreen-terminals-in-vscode","markdownBody":"\nI often find myself using a \"real\" terminal alongside my VSCode setup, because for some tasks the built-in terminal, due to its small size, is quite flimsy to use. *But*! I just found out there's a a way to switch the terminal into fullscreen mode, using the \"View: Toggle Maximized Panel\" command.\r\n\r\nYou can bind it to a shortcut, which makes switching between editor and terminal a breeze!
