The app is quite old, and a lot of legacy code has accumulated over the years. At one point, we decided to migrate a lot of our view-logic from Java to Kotlin. Instead of cleaning the code up, this lead to an even bigger buildup of technical debt. The problem was that we mainly used the migration-tools that Android Studio provides, which, at that time where not very sophisticated.

<h2 id="obvious-fixes" level="2">Obvious fixes</h2>
<p>I encountered this kind of pattern a number of times during my refactoring:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">textView!!.setOnClickListener { showDialog() }
</code></pre>
<p>If you see something like this, your alarm bells should immediately ring. If textView is <code>null</code>, the app would crash. The same behavior is happening with java, so a switch from Java to kotlin would be pointless.</p>
<p>The simple fix is to replace the <code>!!</code> operator with a <code>?</code>, which only executes the line of code if the element is not null.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">textView?.setOnClickListener { showDialog() }
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, if the view <em>is</em> null even though you&#x27;re expecting a value, you should probably do something about this. A simple way to handle this is to add some &quot;sanity checks&quot; to your code. Create an <code>assert</code> function that throws an <code>AssertionError</code> if a given condition is false. Unfortunately, android does not use the builtin <code>assert</code> function that kotlin provides, so you will have to write your own. The neat thing about <code>assert</code> is that you can toggle this behavior, meaning you can enable assertion errors in the debug build, but disable it in the final production build to prevent the app from randomly crashing.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">assert(textView != null)
textView?.setOnClickListener { showDialog() }
</code></pre>
