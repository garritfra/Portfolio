<p>I used to drink two cups of coffee a day on average. One during breakfast and one during the day.</p>
<p>On days where it was difficult to get my hands on coffee â€” during camping for example, or on some days where I don&#x27;t really have time to brew a coffee â€” I would routinely get headaches. This might have been a coincidence, but it&#x27;s not unlikely that my body was craving this delicious drink. Waking up was always accompanied by this nagging feeling of how I&#x27;m gonna get my dose of coffee today.</p>
<p>That all changed when I got sick a few weeks ago. I wasn&#x27;t feeling well for a few days, and as a result I didn&#x27;t drink coffee at all. Knowing that caffeine is a huge stress-inducing factor in my day to day life, I decided to just not start drinking it again once I felt better.</p>
<p>Quitting caffeine cold turkey can be difficult, but two cups isn&#x27;t much. Some of my peers drink way more than that. While being sick, my body quickly adjusted to the missing two cups each day. I wasn&#x27;t feeling good anyway, so what&#x27;s an extra mild headache?</p>
<p>Now, about two weeks later, I feel great. There&#x27;s one stress-factor less in my life. I occasionally still drink coffee with friends, but it&#x27;s not something I crave directly after waking up. I opted for caffeine-free tea in the morning. We also have decaffeinated coffee at home, but it feels to me like brewing decaffeinated coffee isn&#x27;t worth the effort. It&#x27;s still a nice alternative for nice breakfasts on the weekend.</p>
