Its only downside is that it&#x27;s quite difficult to find new interesting feeds.
If you&#x27;re looking for inspiration, here&#x27;s a list of the RSS-feeds I&#x27;m subscribed
to as of August, 2022. Some of the entries may intersect with my
<a href="/blogroll">blogroll</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s not keep this one-sided! If you&#x27;re also using RSS and have a blog, why not
publish a list of <strong>your</strong> favorite feeds?</p>

I hope you and your family are safe and sound. My main focus this month is to expand my knowledge about compilers, by [building one from scratch](https://sr.ht/~garritfra/sabre/). It's a compiler for a very simple language, but it gets the job done. So far, you can write [simple algorithms](https://git.sr.ht/~garritfra/sabre/tree/master/examples), and compile them to JavaScript. A more sophisticated C backend is in development, but I still need a plan for expanding the target-specific builtin functions to provide more features in the standard library. An important topic at the moment is the [documentation of the project](https://garritfra.github.io/sabre/). Since the compiler itself has gotten relatively stable, all the language-features now need to be captured and written down. There is also a [contributing guide](https://garritfra.github.io/sabre/developers/contributing.html), if you want to help out, or want to get into compiler design.\n\nStay home and stay safe!\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Updates, December 2020","date":"2020-12-18","tags":"update, note"},"tags":["update","note"]},{"slug":"2020-11-06-current-doings","markdownBody":"\nHi, I wanted to share some things I'm currently working on. Maybe I'll turn this into a monthly thing, who knows. :)\n\nOne major goal I set for myself in the upcoming months is to build a SaaS for freelancers. Some features of this will include handling clients, projects and expenses. A thing I'm struggeling with right now it to find a lightweight way to host it. It is currently deployable through docker containers, but I am not 100% satisfied with my current setup. I will give some updates on this in the future. I aim to release a very early alpha version for free soon, so that some people can stress test it extensively. For now, you can of course self-host it. I really don't want to impose subscription fees for it's users, but I will see how it goes. You can find the source code for it [here](https://github.com/garritfra/omega-crm).\n\nRecently, I increasingly gained interested in the [Gemini project](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/). In a nutshell, this is a very minimal alternative to HTTP, with a strong emphasis on simplicity. The maintainers clearly embrace a DIY mindset, which I want to follow. I set myself the rule to only interact with gemini using tools I wrote myself. To achive this, I am currently writing [my own Gemini server called \"Taurus\"](https://git.sr.ht/~garritfra/taurus) to eventually set up my own geminispace. I have not yet looked deeply into building a client, but I might do this once I'm happy with my server. I admit that I'm currently cheating a bit, by testing my server using a browser recommended by the gemini team ;)\nIf you are interested in this project, I highly recommend to check out the [gemini specification](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.html), and play around with some geminispaces. Maybe you could set up a server for yourself?\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Updates, November 2020","date":"2020-11-06","tags":"update, note"},"tags":["update","note"]}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[post]","query":{"post":"2022-08-31-whats-on-my-feed"},"buildId":"VYPhm2fTttAtwRaZriPSY","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
