I knew they existed, but I didn&#x27;t know how or why you&#x27;d use them. A recent task of mine involved replacing the unsafe operator (<code>!!</code>) in a large kotlin codebase with a null-safe operator (<code>?</code>). This game me a good opportunity to learn about macros. This is a snippet I encountered numerous times:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">mLeftButton!!.text = &quot;Left&quot;
mLeftButton!!.setOnClickListener(leftListener)
mLeftButton!!.visibility = View.VISIBLE
mRightButton!!.text = &quot;Right&quot;
mRightButton!!.setOnClickListener(rightListener)
mRightButton!!.visibility = View.VISIBLE
</code></pre>
<p>You could go ahead and change each line individually, or use the IDEs built in &quot;multi-cursor&quot; tool to save you some work. But, let me show you how I automated this using a Vim-Plugin for Android Studio. Not that the plugin matter, it will work in every Vim-like editor.</p>
<p>A macro in Vim works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Record any sequence of keystrokes and assign them to a key</li>
<li>Execute that sequence as often as you wish</li>
</ol>
<p>So let&#x27;s see how we&#x27;d do that.</p>
<h2 id="recording-a-macro" level="2">Recording a macro</h2>
<p>To record a macro in Vim, you press <code>q</code> (In normal mode) followed by a key you want to assign the macro to. So, if you wanted to record a macro and save it to the <code>q</code> key, you&#x27;d press <code>qq</code>. Vim will notify you that a macro is being recorded. Now, you can press the keystrokes that define your actions. When you&#x27;re done, press <code>q</code> in normal mode again to quit your macro.</p>
<p>Coming back to my task, I would want to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>qq</code> Record a macro and save it to the <code>q</code> key</li>
<li><code>_</code> - Jump to the beginning of the line</li>
<li><code>f!</code> - Find next occurrence of <code>!</code></li>
<li><code>cw</code> - Change word (Delete word and enter insert mode)</li>
<li><code>?.</code> - Insert the new characters</li>
<li><code>&lt;esc&gt;</code> - Enter normal mode</li>
<li><code>j</code> - go down a line</li>
<li><code>q</code> - Finish macro</li>
</ol>
<p>If everything went right, this line:</p>
<pre><code>mLeftButton!!.text = &quot;Left&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Should now look like this:</p>
<pre><code>mLeftButton?.text = &quot;Left&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>and your macro should be saved under the <code>q</code> key.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-macro" level="2">Using the macro</h2>
<p>In order to use a macro in vim, you press the <code>@</code> key, followed by the key the macro is saved under. Since our macro is defined as <code>q</code>, we&#x27;d press <code>@q</code>, and the macro is executed immediately.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s take this further. You might have noticed that I went down a line before closing the macro. This becomes handy when you want to execute it many times. In our case we have 6 lines we want to refactor. 1 line has already been altered, so we have to execute it 5 more times. As per usual with vim, you can execute an action n times by specifying a number before doing the action. Let&#x27;s press <code>5@q</code> to execute the macro 5 times. And voila! Our unsafe code is now null-safe.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">mLeftButton?.text = &quot;Left&quot;
mLeftButton?.setOnClickListener(leftListener)
mLeftButton?.visibility = View.VISIBLE
mRightButton?.text = &quot;Right&quot;
mRightButton?.setOnClickListener(rightListener)
mRightButton?.visibility = View.VISIBLE
</code></pre>
<p>Macros are really satisfying to watch, if you ask me!</p>

This means that if you try to fetch a document that's *not* the index, for example `/foo`, the server will try to load the file with that name. \n\nBy nature, SPAs only consist of a single HTML entry point (`index.html` in most cases). It's responsible for routing the user to the correct page if there are multiple paths. And here's the crux: if the user tries to load `/foo`, he will not land at the SPA entry point. Instead, he will see a `404` error.\n\n## The solution\n\nA `404` response will automatically return a file called `404.html`, which we can use to our advantage. After building the application, simply copy the `index.html` to `404.html`, as demonstrated by [this commit](https://github.com/garritfra/sendpasswords.net/commit/66bdb68c229a3ac3386f7816a746155e658eb586). This will use `index.html` to serve the application on the root level, and `404.html` to load *the same app* if the page doesn't exist as a file. Whether the `index.html` is needed if there's already a `404.html` is up to you. I left it in to make clear that this is just a workaround.\n\nThis is a [well known](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69308662/9046809) workaround, but I wanted to bring some extra awareness to it, since it's a problem I ran into a couple of times so far.

My ZigBee-dongle, plugged into another USB port, wasn't able to communicate with the devices on the network.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging around, I came across several threads stating that an SSD over USB 3.0 apparently creates a lot of interference to surrounding hardware, including my ZigBee dongle. The fix was simple: either get an extension port for the dongle, or plug the SSD into a USB 2.0 port of the Pi. Since I didn't have an extension cord to get the dongle far away enough from the SSD, I went with the latter option for now. And that fixed it! The performance was much worse, but still better than the SD I used before. My next step will be to grab an extension cord from my parents. I'm sure they won't mind.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 066 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating Homeassistant from SD to SSD","date":"2023-04-27","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, homeassistant, homelab"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","homeassistant","homelab"]},{"slug":"2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme","markdownBody":"\nThanks to [Jacksons](https://jacksonchen666.com/) [update to darktheme.club](https://github.com/garritfra/darktheme.club/pull/79), I just came across a neat little [CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) that turns a mostly CSS-free document into a pleasantly dark site:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n  color-scheme: light dark;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will adjust all elements on the page to the color scheme preferred by the user - without any other custom styles! ðŸ¤¯ It is also [widely supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_color-scheme) by browsers.\r\n\r\nI've always been quite dependent on CSS-frameworks for any project I'm starting.

During the development, I learned a lot about designing components to be resilient and scalable. Here are some key takeaways.\r\n\r\nOne of the most critical components of a resilient infrastructure is redundancy. On AWS, you place your components inside a \"region\". This could be `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt) or `us-east-1` (North Virgina), etc. To further reduce the risk of an outage, each region is divided into multiple [Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html) (AZs). The AZs of a region are usually located some distance apart from each other. In case of a flood, a fire or a bomb detonating near one AZ, the other AZs should in most cases still be intact. You should have at least two, preferably three replicas of each component across multiple availability zones in a region. By having replicas of your components in different availability zones, you reduce the risk of downtime caused by an outage in a single availability zone.\r\n\r\nAnother way to ensure scalability and resilience for your database is to use [Aurora Serverless v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.html). This database service is specifically designed for scalable, on-demand, and cost-effective performance. The database scales itself up or down based on the workload, which allows you to automatically and dynamically adjust the database capacity to meet the demand of your application, ensuring that your application is responsive and performs well without the need for manual intervention. Adding Serverless instances to an existing RDS cluster is also a seemless proccess.\r\n\r\nIn addition to switching to Aurora Serverless v2, using read replicas for cache and database in a separate availability zone can act as a hot standby without extra configuration. Keep in mind that read replicas are only utilized by explicitly using the read-only endpoint of a cluster. But even if you're only using the \"main\" cluster endpoint (and therefore just the primary instance), a read replica can promote itself to the primary instance in case of a fail over, which drastically reduces downtime.\r\n\r\nWhen using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), use Fargate as opposed to EC2 instances. Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows you to run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. It smartly locates instances across availability zones, ensuring that your application is always available.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, you should always ensure that there are more than one instance of a component in your infrastructure. There are also services on AWS that abstract away the physical infrastructure (Fargate, S3, Lambda) and use a multi-AZ pattern by default.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 061 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Designing resilient cloud infrastructure","date":"2023-03-30","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, guide, note, learnings"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","guide","note","learnings"]},{"slug":"2023-03-23-fullscreen-terminals-in-vscode","markdownBody":"\nI often find myself using a \"real\" terminal alongside my VSCode setup, because for some tasks the built-in terminal, due to its small size, is quite flimsy to use. *But*!
