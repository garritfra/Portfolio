<h2 id="personal-recommendations" level="2">Personal recommendations</h2>
<p>When releasing a new version, don&#x27;t just add an entry to your changelog. You should use <strong>git tags</strong> whenever working with versions, to mark the exact commit of the released version.</p>
<p>Read up on <strong>semantic versioning</strong>! This is the most common convention when it comes to versioning your software. (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-semantic-versioning/">here</a> is a simple guide, <a href="https://semver.org/">here</a> is the official specification).</p>
<p>I&#x27;d also advise you to keep a log of your commits in the description of the tag. Here&#x27;s a command that does all of this for you:</p>
<pre><code>git tag -a &lt;new release&gt; -m &quot;$(git shortlog &lt;last release&gt;..HEAD)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>So, if you&#x27;re releasing version <code>v0.2.0</code> after <code>v0.1.5</code>, you would run this command to tag your current commit with a good commit history:</p>
<pre><code>git tag -a v0.2.0 -m &quot;$(git shortlog v0.1.5..HEAD)&quot;
