<p>One major goal I set for myself in the upcoming months is to build a SaaS for freelancers. Some features of this will include handling clients, projects and expenses. A thing I&#x27;m struggeling with right now it to find a lightweight way to host it. It is currently deployable through docker containers, but I am not 100% satisfied with my current setup. I will give some updates on this in the future. I aim to release a very early alpha version for free soon, so that some people can stress test it extensively. For now, you can of course self-host it. I really don&#x27;t want to impose subscription fees for it&#x27;s users, but I will see how it goes. You can find the source code for it <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/omega-crm">here</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, I increasingly gained interested in the <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini project</a>. In a nutshell, this is a very minimal alternative to HTTP, with a strong emphasis on simplicity. The maintainers clearly embrace a DIY mindset, which I want to follow. I set myself the rule to only interact with gemini using tools I wrote myself. To achive this, I am currently writing <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~garritfra/taurus">my own Gemini server called &quot;Taurus&quot;</a> to eventually set up my own geminispace. I have not yet looked deeply into building a client, but I might do this once I&#x27;m happy with my server. I admit that I&#x27;m currently cheating a bit, by testing my server using a browser recommended by the gemini team ;)
If you are interested in this project, I highly recommend to check out the <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.html">gemini specification</a>, and play around with some geminispaces.
