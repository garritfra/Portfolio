This page lists some of my favorite content outlets. If you have any
recommendations or you think your name fits on this list, feel free to [drop a

### Blogs

**[Ben Stokes (Tiny Projects)](https://tinyprojects.dev/)** – Ben builds turns ideas into minimum viable projects that actually make money!

**[Drew DeVault](https://drewdevault.com/)** – Drew admittedly has controversial opinions, but his blog is worth reading.

**[Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk/)** – On blogging, simple websites and life on a farm.

**[Matt Rickard](https://matt-rickard.com/)** – Very insightful short daily posts about Cloud Infrastructure, Entrepreneurship and AI.

**[Randall Munroe (xkcd)](https://xkcd.com/)** – A blogroll without Randall is no blogroll.

**[Ru Singh](https://rusingh.com/)** – Freelance developer writing about software development, tech and life.

**[Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/)** – Author of [Datasette](https://datasette.io/). He writes about Data, SQLite and emerging technologies.

**[Chris Siebenmann](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/)** – The life of a sysadmin. All about monitoring, infrastructure and software in general.

**[Simone Silvestroni](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/)** – Opinions about a better world wide web, sustainability and audio.

### Newsboards

**[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)** – My favorite news outlet. Tech, programming, Entrepreneurship and other important news. Sometimes a bit toxic, so I wrote a [RSS proxy](https://github.com/garritfra/positive_hackernews) that only shows entries with a positive sentiment.

**[Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs)** – Very similar to Hacker News, but strictly focused on software development.

### Podcasts

**[CoRecursive](https://corecursive.com/)** – Every episode is about a piece of software being built.

**[Google's SRE Podcast](https://sre.google/prodcast/)** – Google invented SRE practices. If you're an SRE, this should be on your radar.

**[DevOps Paradox](https://www.devopsparadox.com/)** – Interesting discussions about DevOps and tech.

**[Arrested DevOps](https://www.arresteddevops.com/)** – Very similar to DevOps Paradox. The two go along very nicely.
