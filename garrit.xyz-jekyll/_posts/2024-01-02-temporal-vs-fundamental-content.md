I just read [this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38829907) on a thread on HackerNews which resonated with me:

> I'm trying to read less temporal (things that matter now) and more fundamental (stuff that mattered 1+ year ago and will still matter in 1+ year, with even wider intervals for non-tech content).
This does result in missing ~important things occasionally (e.g. I still don't know what happened with SamA at OpenAI, and yes, I am curious), but that's a small price to pay for greater intellectual sanctity and an increased attention budget to distribute across important tasks or funnel into something hyper focussed.

Is this news important *now* or do I benefit from it in the long term? Our time is the most precious resource we have, and we should be careful how we spend it.
