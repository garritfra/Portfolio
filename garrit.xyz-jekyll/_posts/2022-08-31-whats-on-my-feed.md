RSS is - in my humble opinion - one of the best ways to consume content today.
Its only downside is that it's quite difficult to find new interesting feeds.
If you're looking for inspiration, here's a list of the RSS-feeds I'm subscribed
to as of August, 2022. Some of the entries may intersect with my
[blogroll](/blogroll).

Let's not keep this one-sided! If you're also using RSS and have a blog, why not
publish a list of **your** favorite feeds?

- **HackerNews** ([Pretty](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [RSS](https://hnrss.org/frontpage)) - This one's obvious!
- **Matt Rickard** ([Pretty](https://matt-rickard.com/), [RSS](https://matt-rickard.com/rss)) - Highly interesting posts about software and startups
- **Drew DeVault** ([Pretty](https://drewdevault.com), [RSS](https://drewdevault.com/blog/index.xml)) - While Drew's opinions are highly controversial, I do think it's valuable to read his posts
- **Wandering Thoughts** ([Pretty](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/), [RSS](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/?atom)) - Interesting articles about Linux, SystemD and DevOps
- **Kev Quirk** ([Pretty](https://kevq.uk), [RSS](https://kevq.uk/feed/)) - Kev's posts are always a fun read!
- **Seth Godin** ([Pretty](https://seths.blog), [RSS](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/sethsblog)) - I don't actively follow this blog, but it occasionally gives me food for inspiration
- **The New Oil** ([Pretty](https://blog.thenewoil.org/), [RSS](https://blog.thenewoil.org/feed/)) - Some occasional technology reviews
- **Tiny Projects/Ben Stokes** ([Pretty](https://tinyprojects.dev/), [RSS](https://tinyprojects.dev/feed.xml)) - Ben doesn't post as much as he used to, but his posts are full of great ideas!
- **Tagesschau** ([Pretty](https://www.tagesschau.de), [RSS](https://www.tagesschau.de/xml/rss2/)) - My source of german news
- **t3n** ([Pretty](https://t3n.de), [RSS](https://t3n.de/rss.xml)) - Another german news source, focused around technology and NewWork topics. I thought about removing the description though, as the articles are somewhat poorly written. Still looking for alternatives!
- **xkcd** ([Pretty](https://xkcd.com/), [RSS](https://xkcd.com/atom.xml)) - come on, did you really think I wasn't subscribed to Randall?

Wrote a "What's on my feed?" entry yourself? Let me know, and I'll link it here!
