The lottery is often used as a comparison for something that's far out of reach. But how far out of reach exactly is the lottery?

## 1 in 302 Million

Apparently, you have a 1 in 302 million chance to win the lottery. Well, that sounds like a lot... but how much is that exactly?

Imagine 66 bathtubs.

Now, imagine each of these bathtubs is filled to the brim with **rice**.

One of the grains of rice inside one of the bathtubs is painted gold. This is our jackpot.

Whenever you purchase a lottery ticket, imagine grabbing one grain of rice from this sea of bath tubs. Do you think you'd have a chance to find the golden grain?
