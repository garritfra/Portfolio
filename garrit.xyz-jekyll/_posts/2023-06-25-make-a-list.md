My dad taught me this important lesson. 

Whenever you're feeling stuck or you don't know what to do, make a list. The next step will often become clear.

Whether you're going shopping or you're feeling mentally overloaded. It helps to write down your thoughts in an actionable form. I don't care if it's in some fancy mobile app or on a napkin. Just make a list.

Lists are the answer to almost anything. And where they're not, a spreadsheet is.
