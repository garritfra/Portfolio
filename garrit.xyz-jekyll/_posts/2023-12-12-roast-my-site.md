Let's try something: `#RoastMySite`!

I want to hear your honest feedback about my website. (Not so) constructive criticism, funny bug reports and savage burns. ðŸ”¥

[Shoot me a mail](/contact) with your roast and I'll include it on this site!

Got your own site? I'll roast it! Just ping me via mail or [on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@garritfra).
