I was that kid who would would throw pencils at classmates, hit a random guy in
the balls at the supermarket and throw large rocks through the air until they
hit someones head. Thankfully I've been diagnosed with ADHD at a very early
stage in my life, which gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about ADHD, and
how to cope with it. It hasn't always been easy, and I'm still very much
struggling with it in my day to day life, but just being aware that I have ADHD
and knowing how to deal with it in different situations is invaluable to me.

Although I don't have a problem talking about my ADHD, I did have to learn when
to avoid this topic. Some people start to question everything I do and say when
they learn that the reason I nibble on my fingers is my ADHD. Most people
however don't even notice that I have ADHD until they see me taking medication
after a sleepover.

But the true battle with ADHD takes place in my head. I just came across [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMK4gdR7c18), which perfectly outlines
what's going on in my head.
