Tech news can often be overwhelmingly negative. Scrolling through [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com), I often feel myself getting angrier at the state of the industry with each headline I read.

I don't want to give up on the amazing content I'm discovering every day on this platform, so I built an alternative RSS feed for HackerNews. It selectively presents stories that have a positive sentiment, making my news-reading experience more enjoyable and less stressful. Here's a link to the feed:

It's not a pretty link, but who looks at the link of an RSS feed anyway? ;)

## Comparison

Here's an example of the HackerNews feed provided by [hnrss.github.io](https://hnrss.github.io/):

And here's the filtered, positive-only feed:

![After](/assets/posts/2023-11-24-positive-hackernews/after.png)

I don't want to urge anyone to stop reading HackerNews, but if you also struggle with seeing the bright side of tech, this could be a nice alternative.
