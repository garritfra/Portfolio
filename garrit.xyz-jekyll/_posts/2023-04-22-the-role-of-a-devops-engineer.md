The term "DevOps" can be interpreted in many different ways. It's often thrown around as a buzzword whenever somebody is talking about "what comes after development". Obviously, it's not just that. Or is it? It depends on whom you're talking to.

Although I just recently started my new role as a "DevOps Engineer", I'm still discovering what that term means to me. I just had a fruitful conversation with the DevOps lead of a client, and they phrased this role in a very fitting way.

To me this role is fascinating, since it touches so many different aspects of software delivery.
