This is my first (already belated) weeknote. Even though it's the monday of the
next week, I thought I'd reflect on what happened last week. I already tried [a
similar format](/posts/2020-12-18-update-december) on this blog in a monthly
fashion, but didn't stick to it. With these "weeknotes", I will try to sit down
for half an hour each friday. This is heavily inspired by [Doug Belshaw's posts
with the same name](https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/).

## At work

There's currently an effort to integrate a whole new backend into our
application. Fundamental features like user- and role-management will have to be
migrated to this new backend, which is mostly incompatible with our current
one. As I'm currently the only developer on the project, building a concept
and realizing it will mostly be my part. I'm somewhat frightened about this
undertaking, but I think I will learn a whole lot.

I also introduced versioned deployments for our application. To keep it simple,
releases are versioned by date (E.g. `v2022.04.21`). Alongside this, I also
added a changelog describing each release. I'm still unsure whether this gives
us a benefit or if it's just unnecessary work, but time will tell. I'm curious
of what you - the reader - thinks of this. Feel free to reply to this post via
the link at the bottom of the page.

## On this blog

I'm playing around with ideas about comments on this static website. I yanked
out some thoughts in this thread, but I'll have to think about it a bit more:

## Plants

My girlfriend and I are in love with plants. This week, we went to a nursery and
got ourselves a new member to our family: a Monstera Adansonii.

I also did a little experiment with one of my eucalyptus citriodoras. I cut it
from 50cm back to the first "node" in the trunk, at about 2cm. I'm quite happy
with how it evolved in just about 10 months. It's now time to develop some
branches. Here's it before the pruning:

And this is what it looks like now:

I also made cuttings from the rest of the stem. Not sure if they'll survive, but
what could I lose?

That's it for this week. Thanks for reading!
