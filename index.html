It's expected that \u003e 50k Users hit the platform within a five minute period. Regular ECS containers take about one minute to scale up. That just won't cut it. I decided to go all in on the [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) framework on AWS. Here's how it went.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nSetting up a serverless application was a breeze. You create a config file and use their CLI to deploy the app.\r\n\r\n### The rest of the infrastructure\r\n\r\nI decided to define the rest of the infrastructure (VPC, DB, cache, ...) in Terraform. But, since I wasn't familiar with how the Serverless Framework worked, I struggled to draw the line between what serverless should handle vs. what the rest of the infrastructure (Terraform) should provide. In a more traditional deployment workflow, you might let the CI deploy a container image to ECR and point the ECS service to that new image.\r\n\r\nI chose to let Serverless deploy the entire app through CI and build the rest of the infrastructure around it. The problem with this approach is that we lose fine-grained control over what's deployed where, which leads to a lot of permission errors.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, I should've probably chosen the location of the S3 archive as the deployment target for the CI, and then point the lambda function to the location of the new artifact. This defeats the purpose of the framework, but it gives you a lot more control over your infrastructure. Once the next project comes along, I'll probably go that route instead.\r\n\r\n### Permissions\r\n\r\nServerless suggests to use admin permissions for deployments, and I see where they're coming from. Managing permissions in this framework is an absolute mess. Here's what the average deployment workflow looks like, if you want to use fine grained permissions:\r\n\r\n1. Wait for CloudFormation to roll back changes (~2 minutes)\r\n2. Update IAM role\r\n3. Deploy Serverless App\r\n4. If there's an error, go to 1\r\n\r\nThankfully, some people have already gone through the process of figuring this out. [Here's](https://serverlessfirst.com/create-iam-deployer-roles-serverless-app/#determining-deploy-time-permissions) a great guide with a starting point of the needed permissions.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nUsing the serverless framework is a solid choice if you just want to throw an app out there. Unfortunately the app I was deploying isn't \"just\" a dynamic website. The next time I'm building a serverless application it's probably not going to be with the Serverless Framework, though I learned a lot about serverless applications in general.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 067 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Serverless Framework Retrospective","date":"2023-04-28","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, note, terraform, learnings, devops, serverless"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","note","terraform","learnings","devops","serverless"]},{"slug":"2023-04-27-migrating-homeassistant-from-sd-to-ssd","markdownBody":"\nI finally got frustrated with the performance of my Raspberry Pi 4 running Homeassistant on a SD card, so I went ahead and got an SSD.\r\n\r\nThe migration was **very** easy:\r\n\r\n1. Create and download a full backup through the UI\r\n2. Flash Homeassistant onto the SSD\r\n3. Remove the SD card and plug the SSD into a USB 3.0 port of the Pi\r\n4. Boot\r\n5. Go through the onboarding procedure\r\n6. Restore Backup\r\n7. Profit\r\n\r\nIt worked like a charm! The speed has improved A LOT, and everything was set up as it should be. \r\n\r\n...Until we turned on the lights in the livingroom. My ZigBee-dongle, plugged into another USB port, wasn't able to communicate with the devices on the network.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging around, I came across several threads stating that an SSD over USB 3.0 apparently creates a lot of interference to surrounding hardware, including my ZigBee dongle. The fix was simple: either get an extension port for the dongle, or plug the SSD into a USB 2.0 port of the Pi. Since I didn't have an extension cord to get the dongle far away enough from the SSD, I went with the latter option for now. And that fixed it! The performance was much worse, but still better than the SD I used before. My next step will be to grab an extension cord from my parents. I'm sure they won't mind.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 066 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating Homeassistant from SD to SSD","date":"2023-04-27","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, homeassistant, homelab"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","homeassistant","homelab"]},{"slug":"2023-04-22-the-role-of-a-devops-engineer","markdownBody":"\nThe term \"DevOps\" can be interpreted in many different ways. It's often thrown around as a buzzword whenever somebody is talking about \"what comes after development\". Obviously, it's not just that. Or is it? It depends on whom you're talking to.\r\n\r\nAlthough I just recently started my new role as a \"DevOps Engineer\", I'm still discovering what that term means to me. I just had a fruitful conversation with the DevOps lead of a client, and they phrased this role in a very fitting way.\r\n\r\n\u003e A DevOps Engineer doesn't push the button, they enable the developers to push the button themselves.\r\n\r\nTo me this role is fascinating, since it touches so many different aspects of software delivery.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 065 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"The role of a DevOps Engineer","date":"2023-04-22","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, devops"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","devops"]},{"slug":"2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme","markdownBody":"\nThanks to [Jacksons](https://jacksonchen666.com/) [update to darktheme.club](https://github.com/garritfra/darktheme.club/pull/79), I just came across a neat little [CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) that turns a mostly CSS-free document into a pleasantly dark site:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n  color-scheme: light dark;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will adjust all elements on the page to the color scheme preferred by the user - without any other custom styles! ðŸ¤¯ It is also [widely supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_color-scheme) by browsers.\r\n\r\nI've always been quite dependent on CSS-frameworks for any project I'm starting. Going forward, I'd be interested to see how framework-less sites would feel using this property.

After being unhappy with the Bluetooth connectivity in the OnePlus Nord I bought in december of 2020, I bought a brand new Pixel 7 last december. I told myself that t would be using the OnePlus Nord for at least three years, preferably four, yet I gave in after two years due to some issue that could have been fixed with a pair of cable-headphones. I'm now asking myself again: am I able to use my new Pixel 7 for more than 3 years?\n\nI just stumbled upon a blog post called \"[My long goodbye to Windows XP](https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/my-long-goodbye-to-windows-xp)\", in which the author explains that he is currently replacing his 2008 laptop running Windows XP with a \"new\" PC running Windows 7. He states that he knew the ins and outs of this operating system, so why switch to a new one? Eventually he did switch, but to an OS that is already end of life.\n\nI totally love this. If you're happy with what you got, you shouldn't let a new feature dictate how to change your workflow. Does one really need the features introduced in some software/hardware/tool in the past year? Wouldn't it make sense to use the things that have been battle-tested for at least a few years?\n\nAs I said, I'm very guilty of living at the cutting edge of technology. Maybe it's time to slow down. I'm certain it would simplify a lot of things.\n\n---\n\nThis is post 063 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Older is often better","date":"2023-04-07","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","life"]}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"uhlXqmZe1eQPsTL-7XiYU","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
