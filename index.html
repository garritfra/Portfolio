After being unhappy with the Bluetooth connectivity in the OnePlus Nord I bought in december of 2020, I bought a brand new Pixel 7 last december. I told myself that t would be using the OnePlus Nord for at least three years, preferably four, yet I gave in after two years due to some issue that could have been fixed with a pair of cable-headphones. I'm now asking myself again: am I able to use my new Pixel 7 for more than 3 years?\n\nI just stumbled upon a blog post called \"[My long goodbye to Windows XP](https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/my-long-goodbye-to-windows-xp)\", in which the author explains that he is currently replacing his 2008 laptop running Windows XP with a \"new\" PC running Windows 7. He states that he knew the ins and outs of this operating system, so why switch to a new one? Eventually he did switch, but to an OS that is already end of life.\n\nI totally love this. If you're happy with what you got, you shouldn't let a new feature dictate how to change your workflow. Does one really need the features introduced in some software/hardware/tool in the past year? Wouldn't it make sense to use the things that have been battle-tested for at least a few years?\n\nAs I said, I'm very guilty of living at the cutting edge of technology. Maybe it's time to slow down. I'm certain it would simplify a lot of things.\n\n---\n\nThis is post 063 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Older is often better","date":"2023-04-07","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","life"]},{"slug":"2023-04-01-quality-vs.-quantity","markdownBody":"\nThe amount and quality of the posts on this blog strongly depends on my mood. Some times I want to write about every thought that crosses my mind, leading to 4+ average- to low-quality posts a week. I think I'm in one of these phases right now.\n\nSome other times, I feel like most of my thoughts are not worth the effort to write about, but the ones that I **do** write about, often become the ones that I'm [most](/posts/2021-04-07-pgp-guide) [proud](/posts/2021-10-04-server-side-caching-with-apollo-graphql) [of](/posts/2021-01-18-reasons-the-fediverse-is-better).\n\nThese phases act like opposing forces that coexist very well. Pumping out more thoughts of lesser quality frees up my mind for higher quality ones, and when I'm writing about higher quality thoughts, I get the urge to write more often, completing the circuit.\n\nIn the end, it's not about **what** you write about, but about the process of writing itself. Every post on a personal blog is [a snapshot of your thoughts at a point in time](https://kevquirk.com/thoughts-on-editing-posts/), no matter if you're feeling qualitative or quantitative.\n\n---\n\nThis is post 062 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Quality vs. Quantity","date":"2023-04-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, meta, writing, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","meta","writing","life"]},{"slug":"2023-03-30-designing-resilient-cloud-infrastructure","markdownBody":"\r\nAs mentioned in a [previous post](/posts/2023-03-16-terraform-project-learnings), I'm currently finishing up building my first cloud infrastructure on AWS for a client at work. During the development, I learned a lot about designing components to be resilient and scalable. Here are some key takeaways.\r\n\r\nOne of the most critical components of a resilient infrastructure is redundancy. On AWS, you place your components inside a \"region\". This could be `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt) or `us-east-1` (North Virgina), etc. To further reduce the risk of an outage, each region is divided into multiple [Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html) (AZs). The AZs of a region are usually located some distance apart from each other. In case of a flood, a fire or a bomb detonating near one AZ, the other AZs should in most cases still be intact. You should have at least two, preferably three replicas of each component across multiple availability zones in a region. By having replicas of your components in different availability zones, you reduce the risk of downtime caused by an outage in a single availability zone.\r\n\r\nAnother way to ensure scalability and resilience for your database is to use [Aurora Serverless v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.html). This database service is specifically designed for scalable, on-demand, and cost-effective performance. The database scales itself up or down based on the workload, which allows you to automatically and dynamically adjust the database capacity to meet the demand of your application, ensuring that your application is responsive and performs well without the need for manual intervention. Adding Serverless instances to an existing RDS cluster is also a seemless proccess.\r\n\r\nIn addition to switching to Aurora Serverless v2, using read replicas for cache and database in a separate availability zone can act as a hot standby without extra configuration. Keep in mind that read replicas are only utilized by explicitly using the read-only endpoint of a cluster. But even if you're only using the \"main\" cluster endpoint (and therefore just the primary instance), a read replica can promote itself to the primary instance in case of a fail over, which drastically reduces downtime.\r\n\r\nWhen using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), use Fargate as opposed to EC2 instances. Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows you to run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. It smartly locates instances across availability zones, ensuring that your application is always available.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, you should always ensure that there are more than one instance of a component in your infrastructure. There are also services on AWS that abstract away the physical infrastructure (Fargate, S3, Lambda) and use a multi-AZ pattern by default.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 061 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Designing resilient cloud infrastructure","date":"2023-03-30","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, guide, note, learnings"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","guide","note","learnings"]},{"slug":"2023-03-26-software-is-not-defined-by-the-language-it's-written-in","markdownBody":"\nRust is not just a programming language, it's also a status symbol. By now, it kind of became a meme that people writing programs in Rust have to make explicit that \"X is written in Rust\".\n\nHow fast or safe the language is doesn't define how good the software is. Software in TypeScript can be just as good as software written in C, if written by the right people.\n\nWhen starting a new project, try to focus on the domain of the problem and pick a language based on that. Don't decide on the language before you know what problem you're trying to solve. If the answer to this is always one option (like Rust), [you might be in a bubble](https://seths.blog/2023/03/the-answer-to-every-question/).\n\n---\n\nThis is post 060 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Software is not defined by the language it's written in","date":"2023-03-26","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, opinion"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","opinion"]}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"Act1PyNOSPJfoMfBo3txY","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
