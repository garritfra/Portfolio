Adding the `id` property makes this more flexible, but it\nalso means that your reader will think that there are new entries in the feed.\nThis will only happen once.\n\nSecondly, I want to reduce the amount of the entries.

The next step will often become clear.\n\nWhether you're going shopping or you're feeling mentally overloaded. It helps to write down your thoughts in an actionable form. I don't care if it's in some fancy mobile app or on a napkin. Just make a list.\n\nLists are the answer to almost anything. And where they're not, a spreadsheet is.\n\n---\n\nThis is post 070 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Make a List","date":"2023-06-25","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life"]},{"slug":"2023-06-01-single-page-applications-on-github-pages","markdownBody":"\nMy latest project, [sendpasswords.net](https://sendpasswords.net/) is a [Single Page Application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) deployed on GitHub Pages.\n\nGitHub Pages is configured in a way to host static HTML files without any bells and whistles. This means that if you try to fetch a document that's *not* the index, for example `/foo`, the server will try to load the file with that name. \n\nBy nature, SPAs only consist of a single HTML entry point (`index.html` in most cases). It's responsible for routing the user to the correct page if there are multiple paths. And here's the crux: if the user tries to load `/foo`, he will not land at the SPA entry point. Instead, he will see a `404` error.\n\n## The solution\n\nA `404` response will automatically return a file called `404.html`, which we can use to our advantage. After building the application, simply copy the `index.html` to `404.html`, as demonstrated by [this commit](https://github.com/garritfra/sendpasswords.net/commit/66bdb68c229a3ac3386f7816a746155e658eb586). This will use `index.html` to serve the application on the root level, and `404.html` to load *the same app* if the page doesn't exist as a file. Whether the `index.html` is needed if there's already a `404.html` is up to you. I left it in to make clear that this is just a workaround.\n\nThis is a [well known](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69308662/9046809) workaround, but I wanted to bring some extra awareness to it, since it's a problem I ran into a couple of times so far. Happy SPAing!\n\n---\n\nThis is post 069 (nice) of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Single Page Applications on GitHub Pages","date":"2023-06-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, web, javascript, github"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","web","javascript","github"]},{"slug":"2023-05-19-work-batch-sizing","markdownBody":"\nI've been playing \n[Carcassonne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)) a lot with my girlfriend recently. It's a boardgame about building cities, roads and farms, and each completed \"project\" earns you some amount of points. The twist is that there's only a limited number of tiles, and once all tiles are used, the game is over unfinished projects are discarded.\n\nThe first couple of playthroughs I tried to maximize my score by increasing the number of projects I actively had going. I'd start a new city or road whenever I could, thinking that the multipliers you sometimes get would pay off in the end. Boy was I wrong.\n\nWhere I'm from, we have multiple sayings for this approach. \"Having too many irons in the fire\" or \"dancing on too many parties\". I was too busy starting new projects instead of making actual progress.\n\nA far better approach is to finish projects early, earning less points, but with a greater certainty that they will pay off. With every project you start, the likelyhood of the other projects paying off decreases.\n\nKeeping batch sizes small was a key concept of the [lean manufacturing movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) in the 1980s, and has since been adopted by the [DevOps movement](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) for the IT industry. If you want to learn more about this topic, you should check out [The DevOps Handbook](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-devops-handbook-second-edition/). It goes well beyond the basics of making IT processes more productive and efficient.\n\nAfter realizing that small batch sizes are the key to success, I haven't lost a game of Carcassonne since. I hope you're not reading this, honey.ü§≠\n\n---\n\nThis is post 068 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Optimizing work batch size","date":"2023-05-19","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, learnings, life, devops"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","learnings","life","devops"]},{"slug":"2023-04-28-serverless-framework-retrospective","markdownBody":"\nA current project requires the infrastructure to be highly scalable. It's expected that \u003e 50k Users hit the platform within a five minute period. Regular ECS containers take about one minute to scale up. That just won't cut it. I decided to go all in on the [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) framework on AWS. Here's how it went.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nSetting up a serverless application was a breeze. You create a config file and use their CLI to deploy the app.\r\n\r\n### The rest of the infrastructure\r\n\r\nI decided to define the rest of the infrastructure (VPC, DB, cache, ...) in Terraform. But, since I wasn't familiar with how the Serverless Framework worked, I struggled to draw the line between what serverless should handle vs. what the rest of the infrastructure (Terraform) should provide. In a more traditional deployment workflow, you might let the CI deploy a container image to ECR and point the ECS service to that new image.\r\n\r\nI chose to let Serverless deploy the entire app through CI and build the rest of the infrastructure around it. The problem with this approach is that we lose fine-grained control over what's deployed where, which leads to a lot of permission errors.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, I should've probably chosen the location of the S3 archive as the deployment target for the CI, and then point the lambda function to the location of the new artifact. This defeats the purpose of the framework, but it gives you a lot more control over your infrastructure. Once the next project comes along, I'll probably go that route instead.\r\n\r\n### Permissions\r\n\r\nServerless suggests to use admin permissions for deployments, and I see where they're coming from. Managing permissions in this framework is an absolute mess. Here's what the average deployment workflow looks like, if you want to use fine grained permissions:\r\n\r\n1. Wait for CloudFormation to roll back changes (~2 minutes)\r\n2. Update IAM role\r\n3. Deploy Serverless App\r\n4. If there's an error, go to 1\r\n\r\nThankfully, some people have already gone through the process of figuring this out. [Here's](https://serverlessfirst.com/create-iam-deployer-roles-serverless-app/#determining-deploy-time-permissions) a great guide with a starting point of the needed permissions.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nUsing the serverless framework is a solid choice if you just want to throw an app out there. Unfortunately the app I was deploying isn't \"just\" a dynamic website. The next time I'm building a serverless application it's probably not going to be with the Serverless Framework, though I learned a lot about serverless applications in general.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 067 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Serverless Framework Retrospective","date":"2023-04-28","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, note, terraform, learnings, devops, serverless"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","note","terraform","learnings","devops","serverless"]}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"VYPhm2fTttAtwRaZriPSY","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
